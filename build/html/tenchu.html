<div class="section" id="the-ki-meter">
<h4>The Ki Meter<a class="headerlink" href="#the-ki-meter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Ki meter is something you will rely on throughout the whole game.
It tells you how aware an enemy is of your presence. Here are what
each symbol means.</p>
<p>!! = The enemy sees you.
! = The enemy sees you, but he isn’t coming after you yet.
!? = The enemy things you are there, but he is not sure.
? = The enemy is completely unaware of your presence.</p>
<p>There will be a number in the middle of the Ki meter and goes on a
scale from 0 to 100. 0 means that there are no enemies anywhere
near you and 100 means you are right upon an enemy. Your number
will get higher as you get closer to enemies and lower as you
go away from enemies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stealth-kills">
<h4>Stealth Kills<a class="headerlink" href="#stealth-kills" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Stealth kills are kills that you make in one hit and the enemy is not
aware of you. They usually start with a cut-scene but sometimes don’t.
Every time you do a stealth kill, you will get some Kanji in your
Kanji meter. After you get around 9 Kanji, you will get a new ability
from a level. To learn more about stealth kills and how to do them,
read the Stealth Kills section.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="items">
<h4>Items<a class="headerlink" href="#items" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>There are lots of items that are hidden around each level and you
can pick them up and use them. You also have a items select screen
before you start a mission. To learn more, visit the Items List
section.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scoring">
<h4>Scoring<a class="headerlink" href="#scoring" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Each time you do something in a level, you get points. To unlock
special things, you need to get the highest grade in scoring.
Grand Master is the best rank.</p>
<p>450 + = Grand Master / Master of Assassins for Tesshu
350 - 445 = Expert Ninja / Professional for Tesshu
250 - 345 = Ninja / Rookie
100 - 245 = Thug
0 - 95 = Novice</p>
<p>You get and lose points for some things too. Here are the things
and how many points you will earn or lose.</p>
<p>+450 = Never spotted during the mission
+20 = Each stealth kill
+5 = Each regular kill
-150 = First time you are spotted
-50 = Each time you kill a civilian

<div class="section" id="stick-to-the-shadows">
<h5>Stick To The Shadows<a class="headerlink" href="#stick-to-the-shadows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>When you are in a level that has many enemies, your best bet is to hold
R1 and stay as far away as possible. Try to stay in shadowed areas and
along walls.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h5>Stealth Kills<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Try to always stealth kill enemies whenever possible. This is the best
technique to get through each level.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="know-your-enemy">
<h5>Know Your Enemy<a class="headerlink" href="#know-your-enemy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Before striking at an enemy, it is best to study them. Watch the way
they move, their waypoints, when they turn, what they do, and what don’t
they do. Know them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="crouch">
<h5>Crouch<a class="headerlink" href="#crouch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>To crouch, just hold R1. I think you should do this as much as possible.
Your chances of being spotted are lower than they would be when you are
standing up. If you are spotted, the enemy is a lot less likely to
identify you, which will give you some time to run. They will see
you, but not really know what you are and shrug you off as if you
were something else or as if they were seeing things. Just always
stay in stealth mode. Also, if you need to move through water,
always hold R1 while going through it. This will prevent the
enemy from hearing you and them getting suspicious. It is very
useful in most situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="killing-the-wrong-people">
<h5>Killing The Wrong People<a class="headerlink" href="#killing-the-wrong-people" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>When you are playing through the game for real and not for fun, I
suggest that you never kill the innocent people. If you do, you will
lose 50 points for each one you kill and you will lose all of your
Kanji that you have obtained from stealth kills. To read more on this,
go to the Enemies section and look under the enemy that is called
Geishas. This will help you some more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-items">
<h5>Use Items<a class="headerlink" href="#use-items" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>If you have items, use them. There is no sense and having them
and not using them. They all have their pros and cons so read
the Items List section for more details on when it is best to use
certain ones and when you shouldn’t use certain items. You don’t
have to use all of the items that you have in a level, but if you
have them and you could use them to help you for the better, you
might as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jumping-and-dropping">
<h5>Jumping And Dropping<a class="headerlink" href="#jumping-and-dropping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>When you are jumping or dropping off of something, I suggest that
you always hold R1 and get in stealth mode until you hit the ground.
This prevents your character to hesitate and it also prevents a guard
that is near from hearing you. This could mean the difference of losing
no health and losing some health.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="run">
<h5>Run<a class="headerlink" href="#run" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Points-wise and health-wise, it is better to be spotted, run away
and come back for a stealth kill than it is to just kill the guard
head on. This can conserve health and give you points. A good thing
to do is look for something to grapple to or run behind something
and hide. Just stay there until things calm down and then try
again to get the stealth kill.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="don-t-get-spotted">
<h5>Don’t Get Spotted<a class="headerlink" href="#don-t-get-spotted" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Do your best to not get spotted at all. You lose 150 points
for the first time you are spotted and 30 points for every time
after that. Points matter because you need so many points to get
Grand Master ratings for Rikimaru and Ayame and Master Of Assassins
ratings for Tesshu. You need these ratings to get cool things out
of the level that you are currently playing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="don-t-try-to-kill-everything">
<h5>Don’t Try To Kill Everything<a class="headerlink" href="#don-t-try-to-kill-everything" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Don’t try to go Rambo and kill everything in the map. You should
always avoid any unnecessary fights to conserve health. This might
even help you conserve points too because if you don’t fight someone
that would normally spot you, you will keep those points that would
have been deducted from your score.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="be-patient">
<h5>Be Patient<a class="headerlink" href="#be-patient" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Without the exception of two missions, the Ayame and Rikimaru missions
have no time limit at all. Take your time and do everything right. Watch
your enemy and learn the area.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cancel">
<h5>Cancel<a class="headerlink" href="#cancel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>To cancel the use of an item such as the grappling hook, just press
R1. This can be helpful when you don’t want to grapple to far or you
clicked the wrong item to use and you don’t want to use it. To cancel
an attack, strafe to the right of left while doing it. To cancel the
stealth kill animations, just press Circle. This can be useful when
you have to stealth kill enemies that are close to each other like
the three men near the key at the beginning of Echigoya. This can
also be useful when you are invisible for a certain amount of time
when using the Invisibility Spell. You can cancel zip-lining
with the grappling hook in mid-air by pressing Triangle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ninja-vision">
<h5>Ninja Vision<a class="headerlink" href="#ninja-vision" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Ninja Vision is an ability that can help you in many situations.
It helps you see farther for one thing, and it will also help
you throw items such as the shuriken farther. Just zoom in
as much as you want and aim however you want to aim. This will
help you aim for enemies that are far away from you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="corpses">
<h5>Corpses<a class="headerlink" href="#corpses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>If an enemy sees a corpse, it will run to it. If you hide
behind something, wait for the enemy to get near the corpse
and stealth kill them before they run all the way up to it.
You can use this numerous times to get a lot of stealth kills
racked up in the same location.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="blocking-enemies">
<h5>Blocking Enemies<a class="headerlink" href="#blocking-enemies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>If there is an enemy that blocks frequently, go up to him and
press Circle. You will do a move that is unblockable to the
enemy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-enemies">
<h5>Multiple Enemies<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-enemies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>If you get into a situation where you have to fight multiple
enemies, I suggest you run. They will murder you if you are
against 3 or more people. If they surround you, try to jump
over them because you cannot block attacks from behind and
you can get away from them if you jump over them. Try to jump
on a roof or something.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pits">
<h5>Pits<a class="headerlink" href="#pits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Always remember that the ninja rebirth item will not save
you from bottomless pits. If you get to a bottomless pit, I
suggest for you to look on the other side for something to grapple
to, which will cause you a sure landing instead of a chance landing
when you jump.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="up-and-down">
<h5>Up And Down<a class="headerlink" href="#up-and-down" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>If you come to a dead end, your best bet is to look up for something
to grapple to or look down for something to go into. Just make sure
when you look down for something that it is not a bottomless pit
because those certainly aren’t the way out of levels or
anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="undead">
<h5>Undead<a class="headerlink" href="#undead" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Physical attacks like the leg sweep and roundhouse kicks will
always damage the undead. Other than that, you must have the
Murasama sword to damage them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="doors">
<h5>Doors<a class="headerlink" href="#doors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>If you get caught in a room by an enemy, run out of a door.
The enemy will not follow and you can just go right back in
for the kill.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="too-high">
<h5>Too High<a class="headerlink" href="#too-high" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Enemies can never reach a place that you can only
reach by grappling hook. Use this to your advantage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="poison-rice">
<h5>Poison Rice<a class="headerlink" href="#poison-rice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>When an enemy is bending down to get Poison Rice, they are
completely vulnerable to attacks and will not see you. When
they bend down, I suggest that you run out and stealth kill them
so that you will get the rice and the stealth kill.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Well those are my tips. Hope they helped you.</p>

<div class="section" id="id3">
<h4>Stealth Kills<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Stealth kills are one of the things that make Tenchu so awesome. To do
one, go up to an enemy when they do not see you and press Attack. This
will show a short, slow-motioned out cut scene showing your character of
choice killing his victim in a way different than just slicing or
punching (well sometimes). Different stealth kills are achieved when
performed from different positions by the enemy.</p>
<p>The positions from which a stealth kill can be done are from above, from
behind, from the left, from the right, in front of, and in mid-air. They
are all pretty sweet and you should try them all out. The positions are
from above but not too far from them, from above when away from them,
from the right, from the left, in front of, behind, and a special
stealth kill for when enemies are on a sloped surface. I will now list
all of the kill descriptions.</p>
<div class="section" id="note">
<h5>Note<a class="headerlink" href="#note" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Stealth kills can also be done with weapons such as the blowgun because
if the enemy does not see you when you shoot it at him, they will die in
one hit. This doesn’t have an animation, but it is still a stealth kill
nevertheless.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="rikimaru-s-stealth-kills">
<h4>Rikimaru’s Stealth Kills<a class="headerlink" href="#rikimaru-s-stealth-kills" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Rikimaru has six stealth kills. Here they are.</p>
<div class="section" id="front">
<h5>Front<a class="headerlink" href="#front" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This is a really cool stealth kill. Rikimaru stabs the enemy in the
stomach. The enemy will bend over with his head down and Rikimaru will
swiftly pull the sword out of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="behind">
<h5>Behind<a class="headerlink" href="#behind" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This is a classic stealth kill. Rikimaru goes behind the enemy and slits
their throat and blood gushes everywhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="right">
<h5>Right<a class="headerlink" href="#right" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This is a cool stealth kill. Rikimaru puts the tip of the blade in one
hand and the handle in the other and he slits the right side of the
neck, then the middle of the neck, and then he slits the right side of
the neck. The enemy then kind of twirls on his way to the ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="left">
<h5>Left<a class="headerlink" href="#left" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This is one of my favorite stealth kills for Rikimaru. He stabs the
enemy in the middle of the back while staying to their side. He leaves
it in for a minute and then rips it out of them. When it comes out, the
enemy turns toward Rikimaru because he pulled it out so hard and then
Rikimaru gives them one final slash with the sword across their chest.
Really cool.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mid-air">
<h5>Mid-Air<a class="headerlink" href="#mid-air" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This stealth kill is cool. Rikimaru jumps down and shoves the sword into
the top of the enemy’s back and then takes it out. Instant death.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="slope">
<h5>Slope<a class="headerlink" href="#slope" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This is one of my favorites. Rikimaru hops on the enemy’s shoulders.
When he does, they kind of tilt their head forward in surprise and
Rikimaru stabs them right in the back of the head and it goes through.
He takes it out and does a back flip off of their shoulders.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ayame-s-stealth-kills">
<h4>Ayame’s Stealth Kills<a class="headerlink" href="#ayame-s-stealth-kills" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Ayame has six stealth kills. Here they are.</p>
<div class="section" id="id4">
<h5>Front<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This is an awesome yet very fast stealth kill. Ayame lunges both of her
swords into the enemy’s stomach. She then steps to the side, pulls out
the swords, and does a spin. The enemy collapses onto the ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id5">
<h5>Behind<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Ayame wraps her arms around the enemy’s neck and crosses her hands with
the swords crossed. She then slices the enemy’s throat with both blades.
This stealth kill can sometimes behead people, which is really awesome.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id6">
<h5>Right<a class="headerlink" href="#id6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This stealth kills is really cool. Ayame hops onto the enemy’s shoulders
and causes them to fall forward onto their stomach. She then puts her
hand on their chin and lifts their head revealing the neck. She slits
their throat and then rolls to the right of them. Really awesome to
watch and it just shows her quickness well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id7">
<h5>Left<a class="headerlink" href="#id7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This is one of the most gruesome stealth kills in the game. Ayame does a
roundhouse to the enemy and hits them in the back of the head. The enemy
bends over slightly to reveal the back of the neck. While she is still
spinning from the roundhouse, she lunges forward and slices the back of
the neck, which usually ends up in a decapitation. Really cool.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id8">
<h5>Mid-Air<a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This is pretty awesome. Ayame jumps onto the enemy’s shoulders and does
a 180-degree twist to where she is by the enemy’s face. She then falls
to her left and the enemy goes with her. Ayame is unharmed but the enemy
land on their neck and are dead. Really cool.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id9">
<h5>Slope<a class="headerlink" href="#id9" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This is a cool kill. Ayame jumps onto her enemy’s shoulders, twists
their neck, and does a back flip. When she lands the backflip, she is
standing on the enemy’s shoulders. She then finishes the job and twists
the head half of the way around. Talk about seeing behind you. Very
awesome kill.</p>

<h4>Tesshu’s Stealth Kills<a class="headerlink" href="#tesshu-s-stealth-kills" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<div class="section" id="id10">
<h5>Front<a class="headerlink" href="#id10" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This stealth kill is really gruesome. Tesshu hits the enemy in the side
of the neck. He then throws his hand into the enemy’s chest and rips out
their heart. The guard just kind of falls down and dies. Tesshu stands
there and holds the beating heart in his hand. Really cool and really
gruesome.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id11">
<h5>Behind<a class="headerlink" href="#id11" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This is an awesome kill. Tesshu takes out his needle and puts it in the
back of the enemy’s neck, right below the skull. He then turns away and
the enemy falls to the ground. Pretty good kill.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id12">
<h5>Right<a class="headerlink" href="#id12" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This kill is pretty cool. Tesshu wraps his arms around the enemy’s neck
and breaks it. He then plunges his arm into their back and breaks a few
parts of the spine. Then, the enemy falls and Tesshu does this little
bowing thing. Pretty cool.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id13">
<h5>Left<a class="headerlink" href="#id13" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This is a very awesome kill. Tesshu grabs the guard’s left arm and
breaks it. He then twirls them around and breaks the right arm. Lastly,
he twists their neck all the way around. The enemy walks a little and
falls flat on his face.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id14">
<h5>Mid-Air<a class="headerlink" href="#id14" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This stealth kill is really sweet. Tesshu jumps on the enemy and they
fall to the ground. He then punches them hard on the back and it causes
some of their vertebrae in their spine to break away from the others.
The enemy then dies. Really awesome.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id15">
<h5>Slope<a class="headerlink" href="#id15" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>

does a flip off of them. Really awesome kill.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="with-item">
<h5>With Item<a class="headerlink" href="#with-item" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Like I said earlier, Tesshu has seven stealth kills. To do this one, you
must have the Kumihimo item. If you have it, get above someone and use
the item. Aim it towards their neck and the kill will commence. It shows
the enemy struggling with the noose around their neck. After a moment,
Tesshu will tug the rope and cause them to lift and hang the enemy.
Really cool.</p>

<h4>Dual Stealth Kills<a class="headerlink" href="#dual-stealth-kills" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Dual stealth kills are done in the co-op multiplayer mode. It

enemy while the other player is pretty close to both of them and

different one is done when you use 2 different characters.</p>
<div class="section" id="rikimaru-and-ayame">
<h5>Rikimaru And Ayame<a class="headerlink" href="#rikimaru-and-ayame" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Ayame jumps and grabs the enemy’s head and she horizontally spins
once around the enemy. At the same time, Rikimaru slashes the guy
in the stomach area. Then, Rikimaru and Ayame both pounce on one
of the guy’s shoulders and perform a backflip to land behind the
guy a few feet. They then cross each other in an X pattern and
get ready for the last part of the kill. Rikimaru slashes the guy
from the front and Ayame from the back. The enemy then falls to
the floor while both of the characters are kneeling on their
swords.</p>

up his back, which causes the neck to break. Ayame then runs
and steps on Tesshu’s back and jumps off and Tesshu lifts
the enemy’s head. Ayame is now doing a dive and thrusting
both of her blades into the enemy’s stomach. She then does
several flips off of the enemy. Tesshu then flips the

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Here are the descriptions for each ability.</p>
<div class="section" id="shoulder-thrust">
<h5>Shoulder Thrust<a class="headerlink" href="#shoulder-thrust" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>How: Square + Square + Away + Square</p>
<p>This is probably the most useful combo that you will use in the game
with Rikimaru. It is like a normal combo, but at the end of it, Rikimaru
pushes the enemy with his shoulder over a long distance. This is a great
move to use when you are fighting more than one enemy or just one. It is
also very useful when trying to fight off bosses. Overall, this is
probably the best ability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="somersault-kick">
<h5>Somersault Kick<a class="headerlink" href="#somersault-kick" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>How: Square + Square + Square + Square + Away + Square</p>
<p>This is Ayame’s alternative to Rikimaru’s Shoulder Thrust. This move is
her most useful move in combat. When you do the combo, Ayame will do the
regular combo and then a little somersault kick at the end. Pretty cool
too. This is a great move to use when you are fighting more than one
enemy or just one. It is also very useful when trying to fight off
bosses. Overall, this is probably the best ability for Ayame.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ninjitsu-block">
<h5>Ninjitsu Block<a class="headerlink" href="#ninjitsu-block" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>How: Press Circle when an enemy is about to attack</p>
<p>Ninjitsu Block is a very useful ability although it is kind of tricky to
pull off. What it does is it blocks the enemy’s attack and leaves them
off guard. This is a good time to get in a combo or two. Overall, very
useful move but it can be kind of hard to pull off. You have to time
yourself just right.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id16">
<h5>Ninja Vision<a class="headerlink" href="#id16" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>How: Hold L1 and move R3</p>
<p>Ninja Vision is a pretty useful ability. It just lets you zoom in with
the manual camera. It is good on levels where you are trying to watch an
enemy that is kind of far away. A good example of this is the Cemetery
level with Ayame. It is very useful there because you have to constantly
look for enemies and stuff. Overall, good ability in all situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grappling-hook-combo">
<h5>Grappling Hook Combo<a class="headerlink" href="#grappling-hook-combo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>How: Move L3 in a 360 motion + Square + Triangle</p>
<p>This is ability is sort of useful. What it does is it lets you throw a
grappling hook at your enemy after you have hit them in the air and
bring them back and stand them up. This will allow you to administer
move combos to them. This is only useful in one-on-one fights and boss
fights really. I hardly ever used it though. Overall, it is a pretty
good ability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cling-to-ceiling">
<h5>Cling To Ceiling<a class="headerlink" href="#cling-to-ceiling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>How: Hold R1 while grappling</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite abilities. What it does is it lets you cling
to a ceiling and stay up there for a while. When you go to grapple, just
hold R1 as you approach the ceiling and you will stick. From above, you
can watch enemies, evade enemies, throw down poison rice for enemies to
eat and then attack them, and that’s about it. It is useful in
situations where you have been seen and you are trying to get the enemy
off of your back or if you are trying to get a closer look at the enemy.
Overall, very good ability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="feign-death">
<h5>Feign Death<a class="headerlink" href="#feign-death" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>How: Rotate L3 360 degrees + press R1 + Square to attack</p>
<p>This is a pretty useful ability when you are trying to stealth kill a
guard that is in front of you and will not turn around. What your
character does is they stab themselves in the chest. Rikimaru uses his
sword, Ayame her swords, and Tesshu uses his needle. When you fall, the
enemy will come and look over your body to see if you are dead. When
they do, they are in a perfect position to be stealth killed so press
Square when you get ready. You lose so many hit points after stabbing
yourself and you lose some more every so often that you are on the
ground. You lose like 1 hit point a second. Overall, it is a pretty good
ability after you have learned to use it correctly and have had practice
with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wall-kick">
<h5>Wall Kick<a class="headerlink" href="#wall-kick" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>How: Jump towards a wall and press Square</p>
<p>The Wall Kick is a very good maneuver. All you do is run and jump
towards a wall. When you get close to it, press Square. Your character
will then ricochet in the opposite direction and damage whatever it
hits. The downside to this ability is the fact that there is no way you
can pull it off whenever the enemy is aware of your presence. They will
just automatically block it. When you do it to someone that is unaware
of you, it will usually kill the enemy in one hit. It is a pretty good
maneuver overall. You just have to learn when and when not to use it. It
is a pretty cool looking move though.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ninja-mind-control">
<h5>Ninja Mind Control<a class="headerlink" href="#ninja-mind-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>How: Hold R2 + Up + Down + Square</p>
<p>Ninja Mind Control is a pretty cool ability. When you use it, your
character will do a special hit to an enemy and make them get very
confused. They will start attacking the other enemies for a limited
amount of time. This is a very good move to use when you are going up
against a few people. Overall, great move to use when you know when and
how to use it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wrath-of-heaven">
<h5>Wrath of Heaven<a class="headerlink" href="#wrath-of-heaven" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>How: Press Circle + X at the same time</p>
<p>Wrath of Heaven is the big daddy of all of the abilities. It is the
coolest one. You have to have a good bit of hit points to pull it off. I
think the lowest I ever tried and pulled it off was 40 hit points.
Anyways, after you finish it, you will only have 1 hit point left. If
you make contact with an enemy with 100 hit points or lower, you will
kill them on contact. When you are going to use this move, you have to
time it correctly and line yourself up with the enemy correctly. A miss
could mean that the enemy is about to kill you whenever you get done.
Just be careful when using it. When you use it with Rikimaru, he charges
up and impales his sword through the enemy and holds it there for a
while. After a minute or two, he will pull the sword out and lightning
will come down and strike the enemy. Ayame’s move is different. If you
have ever played Shinobi on PS2, it is like how he dashes, but she
swipes at them. Like, Ayame looks like a flash of light and she is
cutting all of the enemies. Ayame’s move is slightly better than
Rikimaru’s because Rikimaru can only kill one enemy at a time while
Ayame kills all of the enemies that are close to her. Even though
Ayame’s is the most powerful, I think that Rikimaru’s looks the coolest.
Funny how that works. Overall, the move is very awesome looking for both
characters and very useful in the right situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mimic-animals">
<h5>Mimic Animals<a class="headerlink" href="#mimic-animals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>How: Press R1 + Circle at the same time</p>
<p>This ability has the same effects as the Decoy Whistle item does. It
just makes you make an animal sound. Say an enemy spots you and you run
out of a room. The enemy is hot on your track, but your Ki meter is
purple with the question mark. Now, you can use the Mimic Animals
ability effectively. When you press it, it will make an animal noise,
and it is usually of a rooster or dog or something. Well, the enemy will
think that they just saw something or something and will no longer pay
attention to you, giving you another chance for that stealth kill. I
would use it whenever it is needed. Overall, it is a great ability to
have.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="upper-straight-combo">
<h5>Upper Straight Combo<a class="headerlink" href="#upper-straight-combo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>How: Rotate L3 in a 360 motion + Square</p>
<p>This is Tesshu’s equivalent to Rikimaru’s Shoulder Thrust and Ayame’s
Somersault Kick. When you do the combo, it will make Tesshu do an
uppercut and then send a right hand out and hit the enemy causing them
to fly through the air. It is a pretty good maneuver in all fights.
Overall, good ability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enrage">
<h5>Enrage<a class="headerlink" href="#enrage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>How: Circle + X at the same time</p>
<p>Enrage has the effects on Tesshu that the Strength Potion would. It
makes him stronger for a limited amount of time. That is all it does,
well, besides making his arms glow red. This move is very useful when
fighting packs of enemies because you will be able to have to hit a guy
less times to kill them and you can move on to others. The ability is
overall pretty good.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="power-block">
<h5>Power Block<a class="headerlink" href="#power-block" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>How: Press Circle when the enemy goes to attack</p>
<p>This is Tesshu’s alternative to the Ninjitsu Block ability. Power Block
is a very useful ability although it is kind of tricky to pull off. What
it does is it blocks the enemy’s attack and leaves them off guard. This
is a good time to get in a combo or two. Overall, very useful move but
it can be kind of hard to pull off. You have to time yourself just
right.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Well that’s it. Hope that helped you out.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="items-list">
<h4>Items List<a class="headerlink" href="#items-list" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>There are several items to help you in your missions in the game. I will
list them all and give a good description of them. I am going to list
them all before I describe them so you can see what order they will be

<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="bow-and-arrow">
<h5>Bow And Arrow<a class="headerlink" href="#bow-and-arrow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The bow and arrow can be obtained by killing archers that are on a few
different levels. Once you do, just walk over them and pick it up.
This can be good for certain situations, but I would just not use
it in most. It doesn’t take away too much hit points so I would just
keep using the sword. If there is an enemy that is far away, you
might be able to get some use out of this thing. Overall, it isn’t
as useful as some of your other weapons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="spear">
<h5>Spear<a class="headerlink" href="#spear" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The spear is less useful than the bow and arrow. It only has 2 different
move things and it doesn’t take away that many hit points. On top of that,
it swings very slowly. By the time that you get it around to hit the
enemy, he could have already started hitting you and stopped the swing.
I suggest to just use your sword.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fireworks">
<h5>Fireworks<a class="headerlink" href="#fireworks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Fireworks are very good items to bring along with you if you do not have
invisibility spells or chameleon spells available to you. What you do
is, press Triangle when they are highlighted, and this will cause
Rikimaru to put them on the ground and the fireworks will shoot. When
this happens, the guards are going to look up, which will give you a
chance to stealth kill them. This is only really necessary to use when
there is a guy that doesn’t turn around and is always facing you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tetsubishi">
<h5>Tetsubishi<a class="headerlink" href="#tetsubishi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Tetsubishi is kind of like an add-on to the Grappling Hook. It lets you
pull enemies over distances. If you have ever played Mortal Kombat and
have used Scorpion and did his “Get Over Here” move, well, it is kind of
like that except for it doesn’t enter them or anything. It is a really
useful item when you want to stealth kill someone away from other
people. For example, say there are two guys in front of you. Use
tetsubishi and pull one back to you and kill him. This will cause you to
not have to disturb the other guy and get both stealth kills. You can
also use this to pull enemies on roofs with you for a sloped stealth
kill.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grappling-hook">
<h5>Grappling Hook<a class="headerlink" href="#grappling-hook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The grappling hook is the most important item in the game. It is used to
scale walls and you can get on the roof of buildings with it. To use it,
hold down Triangle and aim it at a roof or something. Whenever you think
you have it in the right spot, release Triangle. This will cause you to
“zip” to the area that you highlighted. This can help when you are
fighting people because you can pull yourself to a place where they
cannot reach you. You can then go back later and get a stealth kill. If
you earn the Grappling Hook Combo ability for Rikimaru and Ayame, you
can connect combos with the Grappling Hook and make yourself even more
of a fierce fighter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="poison-antidote">
<h5>Poison Antidote<a class="headerlink" href="#poison-antidote" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>In my opinion, this is the most useless item in the game for everyone
but Ayame. You see, Ayame can obtain swords dipped in poison, so she
needs the poison antidote or it will take her health away. Well,
Rikimaru and Tesshu don’t have any reason to use this. The poison
antidote can also be used to heal you against blowgun shots, which are
poisonous. Overall, pretty useless item for Rikimaru and Tesshu, but can
be a good item for Ayame.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mine">
<h5>Mine<a class="headerlink" href="#mine" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The mine is a pretty useful item if you know an enemy’s path that he
walks. When you place it, it is placed in front of you (make sure not to
walk forward or say bye to your health and your unknown presence) and
will explode when something walks upon it. It can kill some enemies in
one hit and will take away a lot of hit points off of enemies that it
doesn’t kill. When you use this though, make sure there are not lots of
enemies around because it is very loud and will alert other guards to
come check out what happened.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="colored-rice">
<h5>Colored Rice<a class="headerlink" href="#colored-rice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Colored rice is a useful item in confusing levels like the Limestone
Caverns, Gohda Castle, and both of the Tenrai’s Fortress levels. You
see, when you use it, your character will place a piece of rice on the
ground. If you press Select and go to the map, you will notice that
there is a little “marker” where you placed it. This will help you make
sure that you aren’t going the wrong way and make sure that you haven’t
been to a certain place before. The rice can be eaten by guards so make
sure that you have killed all of the guards before placing it or else it
will leave the map. Overall, it is pretty useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tiger-trap">
<h5>Tiger Trap<a class="headerlink" href="#tiger-trap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The tiger trap is a very useful item. When you use it, your character
will place it on the ground and open up the trap. When an enemy steps on
it, it will render him useless and he will not be able to counter your
attacks. You can just pummel him to death, however, it does wear off
after a bit of time. It can be useful at times, but just make sure that
you don’t step on it yourself or you will be screwed for a while.
Overall, good item.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ninja-armor">
<h5>Ninja Armor<a class="headerlink" href="#ninja-armor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Ninja armor is one of my favorite items in the game. Not only does it
change what you look like, it decreases the amount of hit points you
lose from when you get hit. Ninja armor usually makes you look a lot
cooler, but I think Rikimaru looks kind of stupid with it. Ayame looks
more like a ninja though. The item is not available for Tesshu. Overall,
the ninja armor item is very useful and one of the best.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ninja-rebirth">
<h5>Ninja Rebirth<a class="headerlink" href="#ninja-rebirth" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The ninja rebirth item is a very good item to bring along with you on
your missions. You don’t actually use it yourself though. It just stays
in your inventory, and when you die, it automatically uses itself. You
see, it is kind of like an extra continue. You will die and start off
right where you died. Very useful item in later levels like Tenrai’s
Fortress Part 1 and 2 and the levels with a lot of pitfalls. You should
always try to bring one of these on a mission.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chameleon-spell">
<h5>Chameleon Spell<a class="headerlink" href="#chameleon-spell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The chameleon spell is a great item and one of the most useful in the
game. When you use it, your character will turn into an enemy from the
level that you are playing until a certain amount of time is up or until
you kill someone. Enemies will never think twice about you if you are
using it. You can just walk right in front of them and stealth kill
them. The item is especially useful when there is someone that can’t be
killed by going behind them because they never turn around. The easiest
way to get a stealth kill is to use this item. While not being as good
as the invisibility spell, it is still extremely good. Very useful item.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fire-spell">
<h5>Fire Spell<a class="headerlink" href="#fire-spell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The fire spell item is extremely useful in some situations, but not very
useful in others. When you get in a huge fight with 2 or more people at
a time, you can use this and it will be of great use. What the fire
spell does is it sends a wave of fire all around your character in a big
circle. It is effective when fighting one enemy only, but it isn’t
really necessary. I suggest using this on the Cemetery level if you are
having problems with the part near the well and hut.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="invisibility-spell">
<h5>Invisibility Spell<a class="headerlink" href="#invisibility-spell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The invisibility spell is the second most useful item in the game, right
after the grappling hook. It renders you invisible for a certain amount
of time. A thing that makes it better than the chameleon spell is the
fact that you don’t automatically re-appear after one kill. You just
keep on staying invisible for the amount of time that it is available to
be used, which is around 10 to 15 seconds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="super-shuriken">
<h5>Super Shuriken<a class="headerlink" href="#super-shuriken" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The super shuriken is pretty useful. Unlike a regular shuriken, the
super shuriken is around eight throwing knives. You just position your
character in a direction, press Triangle, and watch them fly. It is kind
of like the fire spell when used. It is strong enough to kill weaker
enemies and significantly damage stronger enemies. Overall, pretty good
item.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="decoy-whistle">
<h5>Decoy Whistle<a class="headerlink" href="#decoy-whistle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The decoy whistle is a very useful item. Say an enemy spots you and you
run out of a room. The enemy is hot on your track, but your Ki meter is
purple with the question mark. Now, you can use the decoy whistle
effectively. When you press it, it will make an animal noise, and it is
usually of a rooster or dog or something. Well, the enemy will think
that they just saw something or something and will no longer pay
attention to you, giving you another chance for that stealth kill. This
item can also be used over and over so don’t worry about conserving it.
Use it whenever it is needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exploding-arrow">
<h5>Exploding Arrow<a class="headerlink" href="#exploding-arrow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The exploding arrow is a very useful item that works kind of like the
sticky bomb, but without having to press R3. What you do is, you hold
down Triangle and aim the exploding arrow. When it gets over an enemy,
let go of Triangle and let it fly. The enemy will fly and catch on fire.
You can easily kill enemies instantly with this and or damage them
significantly. This is one of the best offensive items in the game. This
is also very useful in fights where there are a few guys ganging up on
you because you can get a few of them down with one arrow. Overall,
great item to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="binding-spell">
<h5>Binding Spell<a class="headerlink" href="#binding-spell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The binding spell item is extremely useful. When it is used, your
character will make a special seal on the ground around them. If an
enemy walks inside it, they will freeze and be confused. This will make
them easy targets and you will be able to kill them easier. Overall,
great item.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stone-of-power">
<h5>Stone of Power<a class="headerlink" href="#stone-of-power" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The stone of power works much like a strength potion except for the fact
that it lasts for the duration of a mission. The stone of power will
make your character much stronger and will enable you to inflict more
damage on an enemy than would be inflicted with the same blow without
the stone of power. The item is very useful in fights and boss fights.
Overall, great item to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dog-bone">
<h5>Dog Bone<a class="headerlink" href="#dog-bone" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The dog bone is a very useful item. What it does is, it makes a dog come
to help aid you in a fight. It is very useful when fighting 2 or more
people and you are having a tough time with them. Even though it won’t
inflict much damage, it can still confuse the enemy or distract them,
which would leave you the chance to hit them. Nevertheless, it is always
good to have a friend on your side. Overall, good item.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="shuriken">
<h5>Shuriken<a class="headerlink" href="#shuriken" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The shuriken is like a ninja star. It is a very useful item when trying
to distract and or harm an enemy. They will only take away around 20 hit
points, but it is still some. It is better than nothing. If you throw
them to distract an enemy, try to land them on the path that they walk
on. When they bend down to pick it up, you can go in for the stealth
kill. Here is a hint for the Echigoya level. On the Echigoya level,
there are a few beehives. If you throw a shuriken at them and hit them,
bees will come out and attack the nearest person. This is a great way to
kill one of the guards. Overall, great item. It will be one of your most
used items in some of the levels.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="blow-gun">
<h5>Blow Gun<a class="headerlink" href="#blow-gun" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The blowgun is one of my favorite items in the game. What you do is, aim
it and shoot it. It will shoot a poison dart out of it. You can
instantly kill an enemy with this if they are not aware of you. If they
are aware of you, you can still harm them and poison them. When you
poison them, they will lose around 10 health points every so often but
this wears off after a while. It is very useful when you can’t get a
stealth kill by sneaking around or you need a little help in a fight.
Overall, very good item.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grenade">
<h5>Grenade<a class="headerlink" href="#grenade" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The grenade is a pretty good item. All you do is press Triangle to throw
it. It will explode on impact with enemies, but if you miss, it will
just go off after a while. The grenade is a very good item when there
are not a lot of enemies around in an area. It isn’t a good item when
there are other guards around because of its loudness. It will attract
other guards. If you get in a fight with 2 or more people, you can use
this to give you the upper hand. It is also very useful in boss fights.
Overall, good item but it has its limits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="smoke-bombs">
<h5>Smoke Bombs<a class="headerlink" href="#smoke-bombs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The smoke bombs are very good items in almost any situation. All you do
is throw them. Your character will throw it in front of them and the
smoke will immediately come out of it. This is a very effective way to
get away from enemies that have spotted you or confuse enemies and keep
fighting them. For example, if you get caught, you can throw down a
smoke bomb and run around the corner or something and hope that they
don’t find you. If you are fighting someone and you want to keep
fighting but play a little dirty, you can always throw it down and make
them confused. You can then start pummeling them with attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="health-potion">
<h5>Health Potion<a class="headerlink" href="#health-potion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The health potion is the item that you will probably use most in the
game. All you do is highlight it and press Triangle to make your
character drink it. It will fill your life back to 100 hit points, no
matter how low on life you were. Overall, this item is extremely useful.
I suggest bringing it on all of your missions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="small-health-potion">
<h5>Small Health Potion<a class="headerlink" href="#small-health-potion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The small health potion is a very good item, but not as good as the
regular health potion. All you do is highlight it and press Triangle to
make your character drink it. It will give you back around 30 hit
points. Overall, this item is very useful. If you have health potions
available to you, this item is kind of useless although you might want
to bring it in case you run out of health potions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="caltrops">
<h5>Caltrops<a class="headerlink" href="#caltrops" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Caltrops are a pretty useful item. They are like little tacks that your
character will drop behind them. It hurts someone’s feet when they step
on them and will cause them to stop for a bit. This is very useful when
trying to evade some enemies or something. Very good item.</p>
<p>The poison rice is probably one of the best items in the game. It is a
bowl of rice that your character will throw in front of them. If an
enemy sees it, they will bend down to pick it up and eat it. If they eat
it, it will poison them and temporarily paralyze them, leaving you an
open chance for a stealth kill. You could eventually kill them after
using enough rice balls though. A little hint is to throw the ball, wait
for the enemy to pick it up, and right before he eats it, kill him. This
will get you the rice and the kill. Overall, very good item.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sticky-bomb">
<h5>Sticky Bomb<a class="headerlink" href="#sticky-bomb" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The sticky bomb is probably one of the best offensive weapons in the
game. What you do is, you highlight it and aim it at an enemy. When you
think that you have it on target, let go of Triangle to throw it. When
it lands on something, it will stay there (unless a guard picks it up).
If it lands on an enemy, it will stay on them. Now when you want to
detonate it, press down on the R3 button. This will cause it to explode
and usually kill anyone in its path. Very good item.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="strength-potion">
<h5>Strength Potion<a class="headerlink" href="#strength-potion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The strength potion is a pretty good item. For a limited amount of time,
it will build your strength up and you will be a lot stronger, meaning
your attacks will do much more damage. It is very useful in boss fights
and in battles with 2 or more enemies. Overall, good item for a few
situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dokuto">
<h5>Dokuto<a class="headerlink" href="#dokuto" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Dokuto is a weapon that is exclusive to Ayame. This is a special pair of
swords with poisoned blades. When you select them, it will automatically
start poisoning you, but if you have the poison antidote, you will lose
no health at all while it is in use. Anyway, it helps because it will
poison enemies and take more damage off of them. It is a very affective
weapon when used with the poison antidote. If you don’t have the
antidote, I suggest not even using this item because it will do more
harm than good. Overall, it is a good item but can have major flaws.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="kasumi-and-shizuku">
<h5>Kasumi and Shizuku<a class="headerlink" href="#kasumi-and-shizuku" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Kasumi and Shizuku is an item that is exclusive to Ayame. They are short
swords just like Ayame’s regular weapon, except for the fact that it
kills the undead. It is it’s only real use. When you have it selected,
you will drain health for the time that you use it. That kind of ruins
the weapon though. Overall, good item.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fugaku-sword">
<h5>Fugaku Sword<a class="headerlink" href="#fugaku-sword" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The Fugaku sword is an item that is exclusive to Rikimaru. The Fugaku
sword is a very useful item. It is just like Rikimaru’s other sword,
except for the fact that it has much stronger attacks. It can help in
levels where there are harder enemies and stuff. I suggest using it if
you have it. Overall, great weapon.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="muramasa">
<h5>Muramasa<a class="headerlink" href="#muramasa" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Muramasa is an item that is exclusive to Rikimaru. It is a big sword
just like Rikimaru’s regular weapon, except for the fact that it kills
the undead. It is it’s only real use. When you have it selected, you
will drain health for the time that you use it. That kind of ruins the
weapon though. Overall, good item. I would only use it when necessary
though.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="magazine">
<h5>Magazine<a class="headerlink" href="#magazine" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The magazine item is exclusive to Tesshu. It is kind of like Tesshu’s
alternative to poison rice. If you throw it in front of an enemy, they
will bend down to pick it up. A little hint is to throw the magazine,
wait for the enemy to pick it up, and kill him right when he is still
bended over. This will get you the kill much easier. Overall, very good
item.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bamboo-gun">
<h5>Bamboo Gun<a class="headerlink" href="#bamboo-gun" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The bamboo gun is an item that is exclusive to Tesshu. It is a pretty
good weapon. The bamboo gun is actually a gun. What you do is, you lock-
on to an enemy so that they are in front of you. Then, press Triangle
and Tesshu will shoot at whatever is in front of him. This can kill most
enemies in one shot and is very useful against bosses. Overall, great
item to use in most situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="disguise">
<h5>Disguise<a class="headerlink" href="#disguise" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The disguise item is an item that is exclusive to Tesshu. It is pretty
much his alternative to the chameleon spell. When you use it, your
character will turn into an enemy from the level that you are playing
until a certain amount of time is up or until you kill someone. Enemies
will never think twice about you if you are using it. You can just walk
right in front of them and stealth kill them. The item is especially
useful when there is someone that can’t be killed by going behind them
because they never turn around. The easiest way to get a stealth kill is
to use this item. While not being as good as the invisibility spell, it
is still extremely good. Very useful item.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="kumihimo">
<h5>Kumihimo<a class="headerlink" href="#kumihimo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Kumihimo is an item that is exclusive to Tesshu. It is kind of like a
noose. You have to be above an enemy to use this. I suggest being on a
roof. You just aim it at an enemy like the grappling hook and try to get
the marker on their neck. When you have placed it right, let go and you
will get a secret stealth kill. It is pretty awesome. I’m not positive
if this thing can be used when the enemy is aware of you, but I will
check later and find out. Overall, the item is really of no use if you
can just stealth kill them from behind. If they are in front of you and
looking in your direction, it could be a good item to use in that
situation. Overall, it is a pretty good item in different situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="throwing-needle">
<h5>Throwing Needle<a class="headerlink" href="#throwing-needle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The throwing needle is an item that is exclusive to Tesshu. It is pretty
much his alternative to a shuriken. It is a very useful item when trying
to distract and or harm an enemy. They will only take away around 20 hit
points, but it is still some. It is better than nothing. If you throw
them to distract an enemy, try to land them on the path that they walk
on. When they bend down to pick it up, you can go in for the stealth
kill. Here is a hint for the Echigoya level. On the Echigoya level,
there are a few beehives. If you throw a throwing needle at them and hit
them, bees will come out and attack the nearest person. This is a great
way to kill one of the guards. Overall, great item. It will be one of
your most used items in some of the levels.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="super-needle">
<h5>Super Needle<a class="headerlink" href="#super-needle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The super needle is an item that is exclusive to Tesshu. It is pretty
much his alternative to a super shuriken. Unlike a regular throwing
needle, the super needle is around eight needles instead of one. You
just position your character in a direction, press Triangle, and watch
them fly. It is kind of like the fire spell when used. It is strong
enough to kill weaker enemies and significantly damage stronger enemies.
Overall, pretty good item.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />

<h4>Enemies<a class="headerlink" href="#enemies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

</div>
<div class="section" id="samurai-or-ronin-sword">
<h4>Samurai Or Ronin (Sword)<a class="headerlink" href="#samurai-or-ronin-sword" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This is probably one of the easiest enemies in the game. They are pretty
much the normal guard that you will find spread out throughout most levels.
Their attacks are pretty easy to block and dodge. They also don’t attack
very often. Even though these enemies are so easy to beat one-on-one,
they can be tough when fighting them in groups. These guys usually sport
around 50 or less hit points.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="samurai-or-ronin-spear">
<h4>Samurai Or Ronin (Spear)<a class="headerlink" href="#samurai-or-ronin-spear" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

much the normal guard that you will find spread out throughout most levels.
Their attacks are pretty easy to block and dodge. They also don’t attack
very often. Even though these enemies are so easy to beat one-on-one,
they can be tough when fighting them in groups. These guys usually sport
around 50 or less hit points. They have a rather large attack range because
of their spears so try to get behind them or to their side since these guys
are very slow. You shouldn’t have much problem with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="samurai-or-ronin-bow">
<h4>Samurai Or Ronin (Bow)<a class="headerlink" href="#samurai-or-ronin-bow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This is probably one of the easiest enemies in the game. They are pretty
much the normal guard that you will find spread out throughout most levels.
Their attacks are always long range really. When you get close to them, they
kind of hesitate for a bit and run a little. They don’t always do this though.
They also don’t attack very often. Even though these enemies are so easy to
beat one-on-one, they can get very aggravating when you are fighting some
other guard and the samurais with bows are shooting at you non-stop. These
guys usually sport around 50 or less hit points. Their only real attack is
to shoot at you and it takes them a little while to get the next arrow
out of the holder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dog">
<h4>Dog<a class="headerlink" href="#dog" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The dogs are pretty challenging because they are so small and hard to hit.
If you can manage to sneak up on one, jump and press attack. This is much
easier to hit them. These things can kind of make your presence known by
barking so more guards will come. They can be very frustrating to fight.
Just try to hit them whenever they land. Their only attack is to jump
in the air and bite at you. They always have 5 hit points and only take
one hit to kill. You can kill them with one shuriken if you hit them
with one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cat">
<h4>Cat<a class="headerlink" href="#cat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The cats don’t attack you. They merely sleep. If you walk by one,
it will get out and start making noise and running around the room.
Their only purpose is to alert the guards of your presence. They
cannot be killed so don’t even try to catch them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bees">
<h4>Bees<a class="headerlink" href="#bees" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The only levels that these appear on is Echigoya and the Buddha
Temple level. They stay in their beehive until they are disturbed.
When they are, they attack the nearest person. They can easily
kill a guard when they come out of their hive just once. To get them
out, simply hit the hive with something. It is easy to hit with a
shuriken. After they kill attack something for a bit, they go back
into their hive. The person they attack also does a bit of a dance
and it is very funny to watch. They can be useful to you or a menace
to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ninja">
<h4>Ninja<a class="headerlink" href="#ninja" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The ninjas are very tough enemies. They are very quick and attack
often. They usually block nothing so you can get a combo or two
in easily. They move around a lot and do lots of back flips.
They can be very tough to fight in groups. Just try to stealth
kill these guys. Well, you should try to stealth kill everyone
in the game, but mainly them since they are so tough to fight
in one-on-one combat.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="kunoichi-red">
<h4>Kunoichi (Red)<a class="headerlink" href="#kunoichi-red" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>These enemies are kind of tough. It is a woman in a red costume.
Their attacks are very similar to Ayame’s, but they aren’t as
fast or powerful. They are kind of like the female counterpart
to the ninja. They aren’t very tough in one-on-one combat because
they don’t block too often. They do, however, attack whenever they
get the chance, but they are very easy to block.</p>
</div>

<h4>Kunoichi (Black)<a class="headerlink" href="#kunoichi-black" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<h4>Geisha (Innocent)<a class="headerlink" href="#geisha-innocent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>These are just the innocent civilians that you will come
into contact with in a few levels. They have around 30
hit points and are unarmed. They will run away from
you and tell your enemies if they spot you. If you
fight them and kill them, you will lose all of the
Kanji that you obtained from stealth kills. They are
not a threat to you in the sense that they will attack
you, but they will tell the other enemies about your
presence, so they kind of are a threat to you. If you
are playing the game for fun, I suggest you kill them. If
you are playing to get new abilities, try not to kill them
so you don’t lose that Kanji. The geishas will appear as
a bald guy that looks like he is drunk or a woman in a
komono with black hair.</p>

<h4>Jonin (Red)<a class="headerlink" href="#jonin-red" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

exact same as the regular ninjas and are very aggressive.
They are very quick and attack often. They usually block a lot
They move around a lot and try to attack often. They can be very
tough to fight in groups. Just try to stealth kill these guys. Well,

<h4>Samurai Automaton<a class="headerlink" href="#samurai-automaton" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>These guys are found only in the Amagai Castle. They are basically
just like the samurais and ronins except for the fact that they are
made of wood and are a lot harder than the humans. They can have
either a spear or bow. Their attacks are pretty easy to block and dodge.
They usually attack very often. Even though these enemies are pretty easy

guys usually sport around 50 or less hit points. They have a rather large
attack range because of their spears so try to get behind them or to their

looking. They are these wooden robots but with the head of a ronin.
They are very powerful and have lots of powerful attacks. You can’t
get an animation out of them when you stealth kill them, but you
can slash at them once to stealth kill them. Try to always stealth
kill them because they are very hard when facing them one-on-one.
They will also do the kamikaze thing that the blue jonin does
when they are low on health. Even though they are very strong
on the offensive, they have a very weak defense and very rarely
block anything.</p>

tall. They are pretty easy to kill and they only have one strong
attack. They basically blow fire and that is it. At close range,
they have a clawing attack, but they aren’t too powerful. These guys
are very odd looking and kind of freaky. They are kind of
hard to tell which direction they are facing because of the fact
that they always have their arms swinging everywhere and their head
kind of tilted. Just try to stay close to them if you are going to

wear away after a while.</p>

Since it can’t just corner it and do a lot of combos.
Do not get too far away from it because it has a lot of

<p>These guys are bald and wear white, blood-stained uniforms.
They are very tough. They have close range attacks like
this spinning kick thing and other punch and kick moves.
Their long range attack is their ability to shoot these energy
balls at you that are unblockable. They are pretty tough to fight
one-on-one so try to stealth kill them whenever possible.</p>

<p>The cops are only present in the Through The Portal level, which
is a bonus mission for Rikimaru that takes place in the future.
They are big, overweight cops that are carrying either nightsticks
or pack a pistol. These guys block a lot and attack a lot. They are
very powerful too. They are about the same as the ronins, except
they are stronger and block more. The ones with guns will
shoot you from long range and hit you at close range. They are
pretty tough overall.</p>

<h4>Rikimaru’s Walkthrough<a class="headerlink" href="#rikimaru-s-walkthrough" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The 26-year-old Rikimaru is the leader of the Azuma
Shinobi-ryu sect and is an outstanding all around fighter.
He’s lethal with his sword, and he can move like the wind and
he can conceal himself from his foes with expert stealth. Rikimaru
is the “middle ground” of the three characters in this game. He’s
neither fast nor slow, weak nor powerful. He’s right between Ayame
and Tesshu in terms of strength, agility, and attacking power.</p>

<h4>Mission 1: Echigoya<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-1-echigoya" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potion, Caltrops, Tetsubishi</p>
<p>Buds of evil flower in the darkness as the land of Lord Gohda experiences
a short springtime of peace. The fruits of corruption taste sweet to
Gohda’s statesman Nasu when Echigoya’s son Tokubei invites him to
the renovated Echigoya estate for dinner. Tokubei plants the seeds by
loaning money to innocent villagers and then, when payments aren’t met,
abducting their daughters to sell as slaves. Nasu is asked to “overlook”
the process. You must punish the evil merchant!</p>
<p>You start off on the ground outside of the compound. First, select your
Grappling Hook and grapple onto the wall in front of you. Once you get
on it, run to the right and then go straight. Keep running along the
wall until you come to the northeast corner of the level. Jump down onto
the concrete and pick up the white ball, which is a smoke bomb. Now, get
back onto the wall. Go straight towards the northwest corner of the
level. When you get there, there is going to be a guard on the ground
and a guard above you. Get all the way up against the wall and wait for
the guard on the ground to look away. Immediately jump down and stealth
kill him. Then, grapple up to the ledge where the other guard is
standing. When he is facing away from you, get up there and stealth kill
him. Now, go straight towards the southwestern part of the level. There
are going to be guards all around the courtyard so just silently take
them all out. After you have, look around the main building for a place
with a door. There will be a beehive by the door so that will help you
find it. Once you do, go up to it and go through it. Go through the
doors and you will eventually find a little hole in the wall. You can go
through it so hold R1 and go through. Here comes a loading screen.</p>
<p>You will end up inside a house. Peek out and look around the corners for
guards. Take out all of the guards in this courtyard. Then, go around
the courtyard looking for a roof/wall without barbed wire on it. Once
you do, grapple onto it. Go over the wall and get into the next
courtyard. Kill everyone there. Next, look around the courtyard for a
big door on the side of a building. Go through it for another load
screen.</p>
<p>Now, you are inside the building. You need to take out everyone inside.
Go straight and do not kill the lady in the next room. Continue through
the rooms. You will come to a hallway with 2 doors in it, one on your
right and one straight ahead. Go to the one to the right. Keep going
through all of the rooms until you get to a boss fight. This is Tajima.
He is pretty easy. Just stick to using combos and blocking whenever you
think he will attack. If he is about to shoot at you, start jumping all
over the place because you can’t block gunshots.</p>
<p>Now, Head through the next door and the door after that. You are now
heading to a new level of the building. Go through the next level much
like the first. When you get to the next boss fight, immediately take
out the 2 ronins. Keep using combos and keep as far away from Nasu as
possible. Once you kill them, go for Nasu. After beating him to death
for a while, he might try to give up or something. If he does, do not
approach him. Try to get close, but not close enough for him to attack.
Immediately start pummeling him and after a while, he will go down.</p>

<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potion, Super Shurikens, Ninja
Rebirth</p>
<p>Echigoya’s last words were as informative as they were deadly. There’s
a traitor within the castle of Lord Gohda - a man wearing glasses named
Hamada. You must dispose of the traitor and return to Lord Gohda. But
be careful. Gohda’s guards don’t know of your existence and they will
greet you as an intruder. You must not kill any of Gohda’s guards.</p>
<p>This level is easier than it seems. All you have to do is not get
spotted. This may sound hard, but it isn’t. If you do get spotted, do
not kill any of Gohda’s or you will fail the mission. First, turn around
and go get the item. Keep going straight and you will come to a drop.
Drop down and you will be in a room and it might contain a guard. If it
does, just try not to step on him and always walk in stealth mode. Go
out of the room and get on the concrete-like floor. Peek around the
corner to the right and when the guard(s) there aren’t looking, rush
through. If they see you, just keep running. Keep going straight and
keep along the right side. When you see a door, go through it. A cut-
scene will commence showing you kill the traitor and showing that ninjas
are in the castle and are after Gohda.</p>
<p>Time to kick some ass. First, pick up the key that was dropped by the
traitor. Turn backwards and head through the door. A load time will
commence. Turn right and go straight. Head left later on and then turn
another left into a big room with a tree in it. There will be a guard
there so just stealth kill him. Try to rush to the tree when he isn’t
looking and just walk around it as he does. Next, turn towards the part
of the room where you entered. Walk toward it and turn left before you
get into the hallway. There will be a little hole here that you can
crawl through on the left so crouch down and go through. Keep going
through the tunnel until you reach a big room. Then, go up to the door
and press triangle when the key is highlighted.</p>
<p>Go through the door. There is probably going to be a guard there so be
cautious. Stealth kill him and go straight. Move upstairs to the second
floor. Go through this level like you did the other part of the level.
Just peak around corners and stuff like that and you will eventually
come to more stairs. Go down them. Go through the next two rooms and go
back upstairs. Now, just go through the next set of rooms until you get
to the cut-scene, which will mean that is the end of the level. No boss
fight here.</p>

<h4>Mission 3: Limestone Caverns<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-3-limestone-caverns" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potion, Blow Gun, Sticky Bomb</p>
<p>The timing of the Ninja’s surprise attack and retreat made it evident
that they intended to keep you from reaching Lord Gohda. The crystal
residue found on the Ninjas’ clothing indicates that they came from
the Limestone Caverns. The rumor within the realm is that the
Shichishito, the sword of the deceased Lord Mei-oh, lies in the
heart of the limestone Caverns and is attracting evil powers to
it. You must go to the Caverns to find the Shichishito Sword.</p>
<p>You will start this level off in a cave. Turn around at the beginning
and get the item. Turn back around and run. Jump diagonally to the right
and onto the guard tower where an enemy will be. Once you get up there,
immediately stealth kill him. There are two enemies on the ground below
you, one by the waterfall and one on the other side of the level. Shoot
the one by the waterfall with a blowgun or you could risk it and jump
down and try to stealth kill him. Either way, when moving through water,
always hold down R1. This is very important or the enemies will be
alerted of your presence. Now, kill the guy by the waterfall either way
and find a way to stealth kill the other guy.</p>
<p>Move deeper into the caverns now. Keep going straight until you pass up
all of the wood and stuff and you get to a big room. Do not go in. Press
your back against the wall and watch the 2 enemies talk. When they start
walking away from each other, go for the one on the wooden planks and
stealth kill him. Then, turn around and kill the other one. Move through
the cave opening now. Keep moving through until you see another enemy.
When he moves out of sight, run and kill him. Keep going straight until
you get to a sloped part of your path. There is a pitfall and an enemy
ahead of you. If you fall in a pit, you will instantly die. When you do,
hold down R1 so you can crouch and keep walking forward. Get up close to
the wall, but do not press your back against it. When you get confident
enough, jump over the pit and near the enemy. Press square before
landing for a sure stealth kill. Next, keep going straight. You will
come to an area with 3 enemies, one below you, one in a cave, and one
way up high on a ledge. I suggest killing the one below you with a
blowgun. Now, try to stay away from the one by the cave. Grapple up to
the ledge above and move across it until you see the feet of the enemy.
When they turn away, jump up and stealth kill them.</p>
<p>Turn to your right and there will be yet another enemy in front of you.
Wait for them to start walking away and they are out of sight. Run
towards the spot where they were and jump over the pit. They will most
likely be walking back toward you now so drop down into the pit. This
actually isn’t a pit, but more of a hole because it has a bottom to it.
Hang onto it until the guy starts walking again and stealth kill him.
Jump back down into the hole and walk straight. You will eventually come
to a big wooden bridge. There is an enemy there on your left so press up
against the wall and wait for them to turn away. When they do, stealth
kill them.</p>
<p>Now, walk back towards the part where you first got on the bridge. You
have to actually walk off of the end of the bridge. This is a long drop,
but there is ground below and it is the way to go. Now, walk towards the
next cave and wait for the enemy there to turn around. When he does,
kill him. Keep going straight. You will come to a big room with a lot of
water and stuff everywhere eventually. When you do, creep through it and
go to the path on the left. Kill any enemy you see. Keep looking up for
a big walkway. When you see it, grapple up to it. Follow it to the boss
fight. This is Okinage. He is one of the most famous bosses from the
Tenchu games. He has one attack where he will rip at your chest, so stay
as far away from him as possible because this attack is very powerful.
Just keep using your combos on him. If you have unlocked it from the
first level, I suggest using the Shoulder Thrust combo on him. It does
wonders. He drinks a health potion whenever he is about to die so when
he is low on hit points, do not let him have the chance to drink one.
Just keep lobbing him with combos.</p>

<h4>Mission 4: Ronin Village<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-4-ronin-village" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Health Potion, Blow Gun, Rice Balls</p>
<p>The ninja who assassinated Nasu and saved Lord Gohda was not the real
Rikimaru but his shadow. The Azuma Ninjas have shadows that replace them
when one was thought to be dead. One year ago, Mei-oh fled into a portal
when he was fatally wounded. The true Rikimaru appeared out of the same
portal. Lord Gohda’s daughter Kiku has been kidnapped. A letter was left
saying she has been taken to the Agamai Castle in a neighboring state.
You must go to the Agamai Castle and bring Kiku back. To get there, you
must first pass through Ronin Village.</p>
<p>This mission is one of the funnest in the game. You will start off in
the level by a bridge that faces the ronin village. You need to crouch
immediately because there is an enemy near you to your right kind of.
You need to grapple up onto the roof of the house closest to you when
the guy is no longer looking. Throughout this level, you will see women
like in the first level and a funny-looking little man. Do not kill them
and try to stay away from them. You need to move from rooftop to rooftop
throughout the courtyard of this level and stealth kill people. Once you
kill everyone in the area, move towards the northwest side of the level
and you will see a little hole that you can crawl through. Crawl through
it and a cut-scene will commence.</p>
<p>The next area is much like the first. There are several houses and a
small courtyard that is squared off from the other one. When you start
off, you are going to be in water. You need to crouch and walk through
the water. There is going to be a guard straight in front of you so you
need to wait until turns away and slowly get closer and closer and
stealth kill him. Now, move back to where you first entered the level
and turn to your left. Go straight and grapple up onto the wall. There
might be an enemy near so be cautious. Look straight in front of you and
there will be some enemies in the courtyard. You need to go straight
towards the big level of concrete where two guards are standing. One is
going to be walking up and down the left side and one will be walking
left and right on the side where you would have to climb up on. Once
they are both looking away, take out the one closest to you and run and
get the next one. There might be another guy in the courtyard so take
him out too. Once that has been done, look towards the direction where
the big wall is opposite of the direction where you jumped over the
wall. Now, look to your left and go towards that wall. Move out of the
enclosed courtyard and over the wall. Turn right and there will be some
enemies. Take them all out silently and then go straight and enter the
next area.</p>
<p>Now, you will enter an area with a lot of large kegs. Stay on top of the
kegs and scope out all of your enemies. Once you have found all of their
locations, take out each enemy one by one. Once everyone has gone down,
move to the next gate. You will now be in a huge area with lots of
houses and things. Ahead of you is an enemy. Immediately take him out
whenever he is looking away. There are going to be lots of civilians in
this level so make sure not to kill them. Just move throughout the rest
of this area and kill everyone. Move to the northwest part of the level
and enter the gate by the big slope.</p>

<h4>Mission 5: Amagai Castle<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-5-amagai-castle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potion, Smoke Bombs, Chameleon
Spell, Ninja Rebirth</p>
<p>The Amagai Castle seems abandoned except for some strange wooden robots.
Use haste, but be careful Rikimaru. You must rescue Princess Kiku.</p>
<p>This is the hardest level yet and probably one of the hardest in the
game. It can get very tricky at times. There are trap doors and lots of
pit falls. The enemies in the level aren’t human. They are all made of
wood.  The Chibots are little wooden enemies with ronin heads. The
significance of these little enemies? I do not know. It kind of makes
the level stupid in a way. Oh well. On to the walkthrough.</p>
<p>You will start off in a hallway. There is an enemy ahead of you. Look
along the wall on the left and quickly run to the part of the wall where
you could press your back up against it and be able to look at the enemy
at the same time. He will start walking towards you so just stay there
and be patient. When he turns around, go out and stealth kill him. Now,
go straight. Look above and to the right when you get to a dead end and
look for a ledge to grapple to. Grapple up to it and go forward a
little. There will be some lava below you, a floor ahead of you, and a
floor to the left of you. Use your grappling hook and hook onto the wall
where you will be able to land on the floor ahead of you. This will
decrease the risk of falling into the lava, which will cause you to lose
loads of life. Now, turn left and jump onto the next walkway. Keep going
straight and turn to your right. Grapple up to the ledge above.</p>
<p>You will come to a little drop and another ledge right in front of you.
Do not fall down right here. Sure there is a floor, but the floor is
booby-trapped with spears and it could cause you lots of damage. If you
do fall, just grapple back up as quickly as possible. If you don’t just
look down again for the enemy below you. Once he moves away, go get him.
Keep moving through rooms and watching out for guards and trap doors. If
you happen to fall in a trap door, you have to immediately start jumping
or you could die. When you get to a room with a risen walkway to your
right, there are going to be many trap doors and a guard on the walkway.
Immediately jump onto the walkway and just hang there. Move side to side
until you see the guard and kill him when you get a chance. Keep going
through rooms now. After two or so, you will come to an area that has a
trap door and shoots spears from above where the doorway is. There is
also a Chibot. When the Chibot turns around, walk up to the spears and
when they shoot down, wait for them to rise again. When they do, go
through and run and kill the Chibot. Now, you need to use your grappling
hook to get up to a ledge above and over the pit. There is another enemy
here so be careful when getting up. Kill it too. At the top of the
stairs, there is another place to grapple to so grapple again. In the
new area, there is a revolving door that you have to put your back on.
If it does not turn, that is the wrong wall. Just keep trying the walls
in that room until you find it.</p>
<p>When you enter the new room, just keep moving through the areas as usual
and kill anyone that you see. Eventually you will come to a drop off on
your left and an item on your right. Get the item and drop down. At the
bottom of the drop, put Rikimaru’s back up against the wall and enter
the next area. That’s two out of the three revolving doors done. Keep
moving through the next room and grapple up when you get to the dead
end. There are two directions to go now. To the left is a dead end and
to the right is a room with a risen walkway. Go right and stand at the
doorway of the room with the risen walkway. When you enter that room,
smoke bombs and grenades are going to fly out immediately after a door
falls and locks you in. You need to grapple up to the risen walkway
before this happens. When you get up it, just go into the next room.</p>
<p>Keep moving and grappling now throughout rooms. You will come to a large
area with a guard at the end of it. You need to take him out when you
get the chance. Move up the stairs and grapple to the ledge after you
have taken care of him. Hang there until the guard in front of you moves
away and then take care of him. Next, you will eventually come to a pit
with a lot of spears and stuff. Don’t fall in. If you do, just grapple
back out. Grapple up to the area above the pit. Keep going through this
area and grappling up when getting the chance. Keep killing Chibots too.</p>
<p>When you come to an area with wooden rails and walkways everywhere,
follow the walkway that has the red rails. Keep going through this part
of the level until you come to a room with a guard. Take care of him.
Look down and you will see two large gears. If you fall into these, you
will instantly die. You need to grapple up to the ledge above you. Do
not fall in. The next room is very tricky. One false move and the
mission is done for you. There are two very large blades moving up and
down and a guard at the other side of the room. The blades are there to
either hit you or cut your grappling hook rope thing. You need to
grapple to the other side where the guard is without getting caught in
the big blades. Just time your grapple correctly and swing. When you
land, take care of the guard.</p>
<p>Now, run up the two flights of stairs and you will get to the boss
fight. Dr. Kimaira is the next boss. He is a little doctor guy with a
big thing on his shoulders. This is where the Sticky Bombs will come
into play. You need to land one of them on him. Start hitting him with
attacks and when he tries to do a little spinning kick move, detonate
the bombs. Repeat the process until he is gone.</p>

<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potion, Ninja Rebirth, Smoke
Bombs</p>
<p>Ressai explains that there are two ways to repair the Izayoi Sword.
One way is to use the steel that Ressai has on hand. The other is to
mix in the steel from another sword that’s as strong as the Izayoi,
such as the Shichishito. However, mixing in the steel from the
Shichishito may have an unpredictable effect on the Izayoi’s power
that one cannot predict. The heavens have given you a choice.</p>
<p>This is a very hard level. You are going to always lose health in this
mission no matter what. Your sword, Murusama, constantly drains health
from you. You will be getting back health by killing enemies though. At
the beginning, you have two choices on how to repair the sword. Your
choice does not affect gameplay, but only affects two cut scenes towards
the end of the game so don’t worry about it that much. Now, lets start
the mission.</p>
<p>In your starting area, there are only two enemies and both are rather
easy to stealth kill. Just wait for the right moment and take them out.
The first one is facing you so just wait until he turns around. The next
one is an archer on top of a building. He will be easy to take out. Just
go kill him. Then, go into the passageway. Keep moving through the
passages and killing enemies. Just wait for an enemy to look away and
kill him. Eventually, you will come to the exit. When you exit, a door
will drop so you cannot retreat through it if the next fight gets too
heated, which it will.</p>
<p>There are around 10 enemies here and they all know of your presence. I
suggest taking out the ones that look like screwed up babies first
because they can breathe fire and will make this a lot harder if they
are still alive. Just keep slashing and slashing until everyone is dead.
This will be a hard fight. If you are having a lot of trouble, just jump
onto the hut and wait for some to follow suit. Kill them up there. After
they are all gone, go straight and jump into that little well/hole
thing.</p>
<p>You are back into the wooden passageways. Just go through them and kill
any enemies like you did in the first one. You will encounter some
floating head enemies and they can be taken out with a few hits, but
cannot be stealth killed. The next area has a lot of gnarled trees and
enemies. Kill all of the enemies and move on. Back into the wooden
passageways. Move through them like all of the last ones. Now, you are
finally to the cemetery. There are enemies here that you need to take
care of, but there is also an enemy that cannot be killed. You see,
there are big hands that come up from the ground and will try to hold
you down. If they get a hold of you, you cannot attack. Just try to
avoid them and if they start to come up, start jumping. When you get to
a fence, climb over it and into the passageway.</p>
<p>This is the last wooden passageway that you will come in contact with.
There are lots of dead ends, but none that will make you have to do any
major backtracking. Just consult your map when lost. You need to make
your way to a room that has lots of blood at the bottom (The Blood
Room). You need to hold R1 while passing through it or you will alert
enemies. Keep going through it and when you reach the dead end, look up
and grapple to the ledge above. Keep moving through the passageway and
out to the final outdoor area. You need to get to the gate to end the
level so use stealth and stealth kill everyone.</p>

<h4>Mission 7: Bamboo Forest<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-7-bamboo-forest" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Take Along: Healing Potion, Poison Rice, Ninja
Rebirth, Blow Gun</p>
<p>Ayame, another member of the Azuma clan, is imprisoned for attacking
Lord Gohda. She was arrested by Gohda’s guards while she was running
into the Bamboo Forest. She explains that she is being framed and that
the imposter fled into the Bamboo Forest. The imprisoned ninja would
rather face the penalties of death rather than have a fellow ninja
break her out of prison. Go to the Bamboo Forest and find Ayame’s
imposter, but use caution. The forest is infested with ninja demons
and Shikigami spirits.</p>
<p>The Bamboo Forest is a pretty easy level to say the least. The level can
be completed without exploring most of it so I’m not going to give a
walkthrough on the parts of it that aren’t crucial to pass through to
complete the level. This level has many spirits and devils throughout it
and little to no human enemies although Murusama will not be needed to
complete this mission.</p>
<p>You start the mission in a narrow canyon with snow everywhere. There are
a few jonins near the starting point and if one is alerted of your
presence, they will come to fight. You need to try to stealth kill each
and every one of them. If needed, use the blowgun to take them out.
After they are gone, continue down the canyon until you come to an area
that has multiple paths. Each path leads to the same place so it doesn’t
really matter which way you go. Just keep an eye on your Ki meter and
you will be fine. Stealth kill anyone that you come into contact with.
You need to look around the area that the paths lead to for a little
hole that you can crawl into. To reach the next area, go through that
hole by holding R1 and moving toward it and make your way through it.</p>
<p>There is a hot spring at the end of this passage. If you are missing
health, get into the spring and it will revive you. You need to crouch
down in the deepest part to do this. After you are done, move to the
next small tunnel that you can access by holding R1 that is in the same
area as the one that you exited to get to the springs. You will come out
of the tunnel by a bridge. There are spirits and jonins above the bridge
so be careful. Dispose of the enemy under the bridge and go towards the
large opening.</p>
<p>There are two enemies in this little area. First, go get the item on the
left. Then, scope out the two enemies ahead of you. They are going to be
facing each other so they will be difficult to stealth kill. Go in the
opening on your left go around the little wall on your right. When the
two guards get done talking and start walking away from each other,
hurry and stealth kill the guy walking towards you when he is close
enough. Then, hurry and run and kill the other. After they are both
gone, turn left and go up the stairs.</p>
<p>You will come out in a snowy area. Go straight and towards the area with
the big snowman. Now, you can either go one of two ways, left or right.
Both paths lead to the same place, but the left path is easier so take
it. Continue through the path, stealth killing guards, and everything
else like you did before until you reach a lighted bridge. Go through
the gate ahead of it to reach the boss fight. You are about to fight
False Ayame, whom is a clone or something of Ayame.</p>
<p>This boss is extremely hard in my opinion and she has many great
attacks, both close and long range. You will start out with two jonins
and Ayame to fight. Keep doing Shoulder Thrusts to the jonins and try to
keep away from Ayame. Try to treat this fight as the boss fight in the
first level. After they are gone, time to kick Ayame’s ass. Lock-on to
Ayame and when she comes to attack you, use the quick step maneuver to
the side to get out of the way of her strong attacks. When she is open,
use the Shoulder Thrust combo on her. Keep using this technique until
she is gone.</p>

<h4>Mission 8: Great Buddha Temple<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-8-great-buddha-temple" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potion, Blow Gun, Ninja
Rebirth</p>
<p>Counsel Sekiya informs Lord Gohda that Tenrai’s army has taken over
the Buddha Temple. Disguised as a temple on the border of Gohda’s
realm, the building itself was designed as a fortress to guard the
land of Gohda from invading armies. Tenrai’s plan was to keep Rikimaru
occupied in the Bamboo Forest, while keeping Ayame in prison so his
army could start his attack. Lord Gohda cannot send in his army to
take back the temple because it’s holy ground. Doing so would also
be a sign of vulnerability to his neighboring states. You must
infiltrate the temple and execute the leaders of the enemy’s army.</p>
<p>This level can be tricky. There are guards all over the place and there
is even a bear to help them. You don’t really need to kill every enemy
to move through this level, but just the necessary ones to let you go
deeper into the temple and your mission. On to the walkthrough.</p>
<p>You start off near a cave, some planks of wood, and a guard with a
basket on his head. First, you need to run behind a wooden pole to the
right of the little area. Stay there and watch your enemy’s pattern.
What he does when he is walking away from you is he walks, stops, turns,
and then keeps walking again. After he turns around in the middle of his
walk, wait for him to turn back around and go kill him. When he is dead,
turn around and look up. You will see three big wooden plank things
sticking out of the wall. Grapple up to the middle one and go through
the crawl space.</p>
<p>When you come out, you will be in a lower level with an enemy inside the
cave to your right and an enemy in front of you. You need to crouch down
to avoid being seen. When he turns away, go and kill him. Now, turn
around and go back onto the lower level. Now, turn to your left and run.
There is a little drop in front of you so you need to jump over it onto
the boards across from you. Turn around after getting onto it and use
the manual camera to look down at the level below. There is a guard
there so when he walks the other way, jump down and kill him. When done,
grapple back up. Press your back against the cave wall. Look to your
left for an enemy that walks up and down that little path. When he is
walking away, jump out and kill him. Now, keep going straight and go up
the stairs, but do not enter the next room. While on the stairs, press
against the wall on your right. You need to look for a guy to turn
around and walk the other way. When he does, kill him. Then, go to the
ledge that has a drop into the next room. There is a guy in front of you
and a guy to the right. You need to sneak around and kill the guy to the
right. It doesn’t matter if he sees you or not. Just kill him either
way. Next, go take care of the other one when he turns around.</p>
<p>Now go straight. Jump onto the planks and eventually, onto the ground
below. Kill the bear with a stealth kill because this is probably harder
than most of the bosses in the game. This thing has 250 hit points and
is very hard to kill. If you don’t stealth kill it, I suggest retreating
until they no longer think you are there. Stealth kill all of the guys
in that area. After that, go back to the part where the bear was and
look up. You need to grapple up onto the big bars above. Eventually,
make your way to the ledge above. There is a guy there with a blowgun
that you will have to kill. Press your back against the column and wait
for him to walk to the right. When he does, kill him.</p>
<p>Go towards the grayish cave and look up since it is a dead end. There
will be a ledge there to grapple to. Grapple up to it. You come to a
large area with a platform below and above you. Jump to the one below
and get the item. Now, grapple up to the other one and go along the
plank and kill the guard. Now, grapple up to the next walkway. There is
a pit in front of you. Hook the grappling hook to the roof above the
floor and immediately turn to the right and kill that guard. Then, turn
around and turn right.</p>
<p>Jump down into the next area. Keep on moving through the passages. When
you drop down to the wooden corridor, it looks like a dead end, but look
up. It’s not. Grapple up to the area above. You will now come to a
boarded up area. Next, perch up on the wooden planks, walk off of it,
and move back so that you land on the area right below. Move down the
corridor to an area that has a hole that you can crawl in. Keep going
until you come to the next area that has a ledge above you. Grapple up
and keep moving. When you come outside, take out the nearby guard. There
is another bear ahead so try to avoid it. Now, you need to go back into
the temple. Look above the hole where you entered the area from for the
way. Once you’re inside, move through the corridors and when you are in
the main room, drop down to start the boss fights.</p>
<p>There are two bosses to fight now, but not at the same time. Your first
is Kagura. There is a giant that hits you instead of her. You cannot
kill the giant, so go for the girl. Just keep doing combos to her and
she will die eventually. Try to stay as far away from the giant as
possible. Next is Tatsumaru. Tatsumaru is probably the second strongest
boss, right after Tenrai. He has many powerful close range attacks so
try to stay as far away from him as possible. Just keep doing combos to
him until he is dead.</p>

<h4>Mission 9: Tenrai Fortress Part 1<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-9-tenrai-fortress-part-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potions, Sticky Bombs, Ninja
Rebirth, Blow Gun</p>
<p>Two days have passed since the battle at the Buddha Temple. The moon
is full and the fog has lifted. Rikimaru, you must go to Tenrai’s Fortress
and defeat Tenrai.</p>
<p>This mission is very tough. There are lots of dangers in this level. The
enemies seem like they are tougher and there are loads of pitfalls.
There are Monks, undeads, and jonins throughout this level. If you don’t
want to kill the undead, which would mean not bringing the Murusama
sword, you do not have to, but it would help you rack up on the stealth
kills.</p>
<p>In the first area, just scan it for jonins and stealth kill anyone you
see. Move on to the area with the big log. Move across the log halfway.
Scan the area below for all of the enemies and watch the ways they move.
Then, jump down to the roof of the house below. Whenever you think you
have the best chance, stealth kill one of the enemies and quickly take
care of the other one. If you need to, you can always jump back onto the
roof after killing one and wait for the other again. There is a health
potion on the far side of the building so get it. When everyone is gone,
go around the corner. You should always keep an eye on your Ki meter and
stealth kill all of the enemies that you come in contact with, but I’m
pretty sure you know that already. Keep going until you reach a very
large room.</p>
<p>This room has a lot of enemies in it and it will be pretty hard to make
your way around it and stealth kill them all, but it is for the best
considering that they are extremely hard to fight since they are so
strong and they will have other enemies to come and help them. The
room’s exit is on the far right side. Just kill all of the enemies and
make your way to that part. Ok I will give you a strategy on the guard
near the exit. He is standing right by it and will almost never move.
What you need to do is, grapple up to the wall along the side of the
cave that is to the enemy’s left. Then, press your back against the wall
and slowly creep towards him. When he looks to his right a little, go
out and stay close to the wall. Run and kill him with a stealth kill.</p>
<p>Now, go through the opening and climb the stairs. These next few rooms
contain large guns that overlook the fortress’s outside compound and the
areas have lots of enemies. Keep going through the gun rooms and stealth
killing all of the enemies. In the next gun room, you need to look for
an area above you that you can grapple to. When you see it, grapple up.
There will be a monk in front of you so wait until he turns. When he
does, take him out. Then move to the left side of the platform. Find the
small wooden bridge on the left side and go on it. Continue through the
corridors and stealth kill any enemies that get in your way. Continue
through the rooms until you reach a room with a female guard in the
bottom of it. Use a blowgun to take her out, and then move up the step-
like stones. There is a jonin at the top of one of the steps so you need
to kill him when you get the chance.</p>
<p>After you do, search the area for the top of a guard tower. Jump onto it
or leap to the area below it. Continue in the only direction possible
until the boss chamber. You are about to face Okinage, yet again. This
is where the sticky bombs come into play. I suggest throwing two onto
him at the beginning of the fight. When you get him down to 50 hit
points, detonate both of the sticky bombs simultaneously. This will
instantly kill him. Before that, just stay as far away from him as
possible and do the Shoulder Thrust combo whenever you feel that you
have a good chance. Okinage has a lot of powerful close range attacks so
just keep away. After that, detonate the sticky bombs like I said before
because if you don’t, Okinage will drink a Health Potion whenever he
feels that he is low on health and you will have to do it all over
again.</p>

<h4>Mission 10: Tenrai Fortress Part 2<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-10-tenrai-fortress-part-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potions, Exploding Arrows,
Sticky Bombs, Ninja Rebirth, Murusama Sword</p>
<p>This is the last mission in the game. You are still in Tenrai’s Fortress
and have just killed Okinage. Time to go for the big dog, Tenrai. He is
an old guy with some badass attacks. This level is crawling with enemies
and undeads so you will need to bring the Murusama sword with you.</p>
<p>When you start out, immediately grapple up to the ledge above you. As
you did in the last mission, you need to move through all of the
hallways and kill any enemies that you come in contact with. Keep an eye
on your Ki meter as it will help you a lot in this fight. Keep going to
an area where there are multiple pathways. All of the paths lead to the
same place, but they are slightly different. Just pick one and move
through it, killing anyone you see. After patrolling the maze, you come
to the exit of this level. Jump to the raised doorway. There are lots of
female ninja guards so keep a look out for them.</p>
<p>Keep going until you come to a room with several large pillars in it.
Use the grappling hook to reach the first pillar. Then, look around for
an opening in the wall that has an item in it. Jump into it get it.
Then, jump back onto the first pillar. Grapple up to the other ones and
then grapple to the ledge that will let you keep progressing in the
level. The next room contains pillars that you have to jump onto. One
false step and you will fall to your death. Jump from pillar to pillar
and eventually, to the ledge by the wall in front of you. If you want,
you could always use the grappling hook instead of making the last jump
because it is more of a sure thing. Now, walk down the walkway until you
see a jonin. When you do, time yourself right and eventually kill him.</p>
<p>Move around the room and go up the steps, step by step. The next room is
a grid that contains a lot of enemies. You should use your Ki meter a
lot here. When you get to the staircase, look up and grapple up. Now,
grapple up again to the ledge above. Go up the staircase and eventually,
you will see an enemy and a gap in the staircase. Try to take him out
with a blowgun or a stick bomb or something because you don’t want to
have to fight him on such a narrow strip. If you have to fight him,
proceed with caution. After he is dead, climb up onto the walkway above.
Look to your left and grapple to that side. Kill the guard right by you.
Then, go along the walkway and look down. You should see a big drop with
an area you can drop to with an item. Drop down and get it. Next, look
up the wall to your left. Grapple up to the ledge above. Just keep
grappling and jumping around until you get to Tenrai. You should have no
further problems until you get to him.</p>
<p>Now you are up to the final boss of the game, Tenrai. He has three
phases. Each phase is stronger than the last. First up is his weakest
phase that has 150 hit points. I suggest using the Exploding Arrows or
Sticky Bombs on him, but don’t use too many. Save some for later phases.
In the first phase, he will have several long range and short range
attacks. Just keep him locked-on and move around a lot. Use combos to
him whenever you feel you have a good chance. After he is dead, here
comes the second phase. The second phase is a lot harder and has 200 hit
points. Your hits at first will seem as if they are not doing any
damage, but after a while, there will be a cut-scene and then they will
start to. He seems to block a lot now, but just keep trying to do combos
and eventually you will kill him. Use the same techniques as the first
phase. Here comes the third phase along with it’s 200 hit points. The
third phase is probably the easiest. Just keep using the same techniques
as the first and second phase and you will win eventually.</p>

<h4>Ayame’s Walkthrough<a class="headerlink" href="#ayame-s-walkthrough" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>At 22, Ayame is a bold, quick, silent, and cunning ninja. She
has been trained since childhood. As sharp with her tongue
as she is with her sword, Ayame uses an acrobatical style
of ninjitsu to overcome obstacles living or dead. She adores
Gohda’s daughter Kiku like her own baby sister.</p>
<p>Ayame is a quicker fighter than Rikimaru. Not only can she
move and jump better than her male counterpart, but she
can hit the enemy with faster combinations as well. The
trade-off is that her attacks cause less damage, so
she must hit the enemy more to get the same
results.</p>

<h4>Mission 1: Bamboo Forest<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-1-bamboo-forest" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potion, Caltrops, Sticky Bombs</p>
<p>A villager bursts into tears in front of town officials. He explains
that his daughter was abducted as payment for a loan he couldn’t repay.
Other village girls have been disappearing in the night as well.
Witnesses come forth with news that the village girls were taken to
the temple in the Bamboo Forest. Because of the Temple, the Bamboo
Forest is considered holy ground and cannot be disturbed by the
government and the police. Lord Gohda has no choice but to send you
into the Bamboo Forest for silent justice.</p>
<p>This is your first mission in the game with Ayame and it is rather easy.
Most of the guards in the level can be stealth killed with ease and the
end boss isn’t too hard. The only real problem is that the map can be
kind of complicated although it is nothing compared to some of the later
levels like Amagai Castle. This is a rather fun mission in my opinion.
Well, on with the walkthrough.</p>
<p>You start off on a sloped walkway that leads to a bridge. On the ground
below, you see a lot of snow and a guard whom needs to be killed. Watch
the guard for a while and when he turns his back to you to start walking
in the other direction, run down the walkway and go behind him to
stealth kill him. I need you to go do something now. Go to the side of
the bridge where the walkway is and look for a glowing hole. See it?
Well, it is possible to climb in it. That is the hole that leads to the
hot springs. You must remember this for a moment. Now turn around and
walk forward until you get to a huge cave. That is just the cave area. I
need you to remember these two places.</p>
<p>Now, you have an option of what you want to do here. If you want to rack
up a lot of stealth kills and make it easier to fill your Kanji so you
can get a new ability, you can go back up to the bridge and follow it
all the way until you get to an area that has a passage to the hot
springs. When you do, take that passage. You will end up at the
beginning of the level. Keep in mind that this is not a necessary thing
to do to get the new ability and it is entirely possible to get it
without going that way. If you choose to do this, always watch your Ki
meter and just use stealth as best as you can.</p>
<p>Your second option is to follow the rest of the walkthrough. Ok I will
start the rest now so follow it if you aren’t going to go now or follow
it when you get back to the beginning of the level if you choose to go
across the bridge. Alright, enter the mouth of the cave slightly, but
not much. There are two enemies in this little area. First, go get the
item on the left. Then, scope out the two enemies ahead of you. They are
going to be facing each other so they will be difficult to stealth kill.
Go in the opening on your left go around the little wall on your right.
When the two guards get done talking and start walking away from each
other, hurry and stealth kill the guy walking towards you when he is
close enough. Then, hurry and run and kill the other. After they are
both gone, turn left and go up the stairs. Crouch when getting out into
the outside again in case there are any enemies around you.</p>
<p>You will come out in a snowy area. Go straight and towards the area with
the big snowman. Now, you can either go one of two ways, left or right.
Both paths lead to the same place, but the left path is easier so take
it. Continue through the path, stealth killing guards, and everything
else like you did before until you reach a lighted bridge. Go through
the gate ahead of it to reach the boss fight. You are about to fight
Tajima.</p>
<p>Tajima is rather easy. He has a gun and a sword and doesn’t attack too
often although he does move around and block a good bit. Just stick to
using combos and blocking whenever you think he will attack. If he is
about to shoot at you, start jumping all over the place because you
can’t block gunshots. After he is gone, you have beaten the first
mission for Ayame.</p>

<h4>Mission 2: Echigoya<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-2-echigoya" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potion, Caltrops, Sticky Bombs</p>
<p>The mention of Echigoya’s name by Tajima in the Bamboo Forest was proof
that Tokubei had inherited the family business after his father was killed.
You must infiltrate the Echigoya estate and punish the evil merchant.</p>
<p>You start off on the ground outside of the compound. First, select your
Grappling Hook and grapple onto the wall in front of you. Once you get
on it, run to the right and then go straight. Keep running along the
wall until you come to the northeast corner of the level. Jump down onto
the concrete and pick up the white ball, which is a smoke bomb. Now, get
back onto the wall. Go straight towards the northwest corner of the
level.</p>
<p>When you get there, there is going to be a guard on the ground and a
guard above you. Get all the way up against the wall and wait for the
guard on the ground to look away. Immediately jump down and stealth kill
him. Then, grapple up to the ledge where the other guard is standing.
When he is facing away from you, get up there and stealth kill him. Now,
go straight towards the southwestern part of the level.</p>
<p>There are going to be guards all around the courtyard so just silently
take them all out. After you have, look around the main building for a
place with a door. There will be a beehive by the door so that will help
you find it. Once you do, go up to it and go through it. Go through the
doors and you will eventually find a little hole in the wall. You can go
through it so hold R1 and go through. Here comes a loading screen.</p>
<p>You will end up inside a house. Peek out and look around the corners for
guards. Take out all of the guards in this courtyard. Then, go around
the courtyard looking for a roof/wall without barbed wire on it. Once
you do, grapple onto it. Go over the wall and get into the next
courtyard. Kill everyone there. Next, look around the courtyard for a
big door on the side of a building. Go through it for another load
screen.</p>
<p>Now, you are inside the building. You need to take out everyone inside.
Go straight and do not kill the lady in the next room. Continue through
the rooms. You will come to a hallway with 2 doors in it, one on your
right and one straight ahead. Go to the one to the right. Head through
this room. Now, Head through the next door and the door after that. You
are now heading to a new level of the building. Go through the next
level much like the first.</p>
<p>When you get to the next boss fight, immediately take out the 2 ronins.
Keep using combos and keep as far away from Nasu as possible. Once you
kill them, go for Nasu. After beating him to death for a while, he might
try to give up or something. If he does, do not approach him. Try to get
close, but not close enough for him to attack. Immediately start
pummeling him and after a while, he will go down. After you kill him,
run down to the first floor of the building to end the mission. Just go
down those stairs from earlier.</p>

<h4>Mission 3: Gohda Castle<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-3-gohda-castle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potion, Blow Gun, Poison Rice</p>
<p>Lord Gohda nods quietly as you report to him about the three jewels that
Echigoya spoke of. However, he makes no mention of it and asks you to
forget the conversation. A few months later, a treacherous incident occurs.
Hamada, on of Lord Gohda’s men, takes Gohda hostage and demands that the
Jewel of Virtue be brought to him. Timed with Hamada’s acts of treason,
a mysterious band of Ninjas attacks the castle and takes over every floor.
You must hurry to rescue Lord Gohda and dispose of the traitor.</p>
<p>This level is easier than it seems. There are loads of guys on this
level and you should have no trouble to get the new ability. You start
off in a room with a concrete-like floor. When the level begins,
immediately hold down R1 and look for enemies. From the position you
were facing when the level started, there was a way to go in front of
you and to the right of you. Go to the right. Peek around the corner to
the right and when the guard(s) there aren’t looking, rush to them and
stealth kill them. If they see you, fight them. Keep going straight and
take the left turn. Keep going straight and keep along the right side.
When you see a door, go through it. Go through the secret door in the
room. It really isn’t secret, but it doesn’t look like a door.</p>
<p>Next, turn left and go straight. Go through the door and kill the enemy
in there. Then, go up the staircase. Go through the door. There is
probably going to be a guard there so be cautious. Stealth kill him and
go straight. Move upstairs to the second floor. Go through this level
like you did the other part of the level. Just peak around corners and
stuff like that and you will eventually come to more stairs. Go down
them. Go through the next two rooms and go back upstairs. Now, just go
through the next set of rooms until you get to the cut-scene, which will
make the boss fight begin.</p>
<p>This is Hamada. He is overall pretty easy, but he is definitely harder
than any enemy that you have faced so far with Ayame. He blocks a lot
and attacks even more. Just keep him locked on and dodging his attacks
with the R2 + X + L3 move and using combos on him. You will do fine.
After he is dead, you are done.</p>

<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potion, Blow Gun, Strength
Potion</p>
<p>The mysterious voice that emanated from Hamada’s corpse called himself
Tenrai. Gohda is shocked that Tenrai knew of the three secret jewels.
Long ago, the jewels of Heaven, Earth and Virtue gave the Gohda family
the power to control the realm. Two of these jewels were stolen by thieves.
The third one, still in Gohda’s possession, is the Jewel of Virtue. With
the Jewel of Earth in Tenrai’s possession, Gohda must find the Jewel of
Heaven before Tenrai gets his hands on it. But before that, Gohda must prepare
for other attacks by Tenrai.By controlling Hamada’s dead body, Tenrai
has proven himself to be a master of spiritual powers. Lord Gohda
knows that he needs weapons of equal spiritual strength to fight back
if Tenrai ever attacks again. Gohda’s family diaries speak of Yoto Swords,
which were so spiritually powerful that his ancestors had to seal them
in a shrine in the Cemetery to keep them from taking the lives of their
owners. To get to this shrine, now an old house, one had to break five
sealing stones within the Cemetery. You must go to the shrine in the
Cemetery to retrieve the Yoto Swords, but be careful. The spirits blocking
your path cannot be hurt by normal swords.</p>
<p>This level is going to be pretty hard. There are undead enemies and
ninja enemies in this level. The thing is, you don’t have the right
sword to kill the undead so you must not let them know you are there
since you can’t take them on. The ninjas, however, can be killed and you
will have to kill them. Keep an eye on the Ki meter at all times.</p>
<p>I just want to start off by telling you that if an undead spots you, he
will attack you and call over a ninja to help him. When you start the
mission, you have an undead enemy near you. Use stealth and roll from
tree to tree as you make your way down the path. You need to destroy a
Sealing Stone so that you can open up the passageway so look for it and
destroy it and make your way into the first passageway. Time to kill
some ninjas.</p>
<p>Once you get inside, keep going through it and doing the normal routine,
just stealth killing the ninjas and watching the Ki meter. When you get
to the Blood Room, wait for a second and read the next part. This next
part is tricky. There is an undead in the bottom of the Blood Room
somewhere. What you need to do is drop down while holding R1 and move
through it while holding R1. If the undead spots you, you can let go off
R1 and run. R1 makes the enemy not here you in liquids by the way.
Anyways, you need to grapple up to a ledge above on the other side of
the Blood Room on the opposite end of where you started.</p>
<p>Now just keep going through the passageway and come out of it. Go into
the next area and jump over the large fence. There is a Sealing Stone in
the next part of the area. You need to destroy it. Do not move on until
you do. After you do, go into the next passageway on the far side of the
area. Watch your Ki meter when searching for the Sealing Stone, as there
are ninjas in the area. Anyways, when you get in the next passageway,
just keep moving and doing business as usual. You will run into some
floating head enemies, but you cannot kill them so don’t try. Just keep
moving until you get back outside.</p>
<p>The next area has three enemies in it and they are all ninjas. You can
easily kill them all with stealth kills. Before exiting this area, make
sure you destroy the Sealing Stone. Then, go into the next passageway.
Keep going until you get to a huge gap. Grapple to the other side and
wait there. Turn and look for an undead and a ninja. Wait for the undead
to go on it’s patrol and get out of sight. When it does, grapple back
across and go kill the ninja and keep moving. When you get to a dead
end, look up for a hole in the roof. Grapple out of the hole and into
the next area.</p>
<p>Run to the sealing stone in the middle of the area and destroy it. After
that, run to the hut. Here is another boss fight. This headless giant’s
name is, well, Headless Giant. He is huge and is carrying his own hand
in his hand. This guy is much easier than he looks. He is rather easy
considering he almost never blocks. Just keep doing combos to him and
dodging his attacks and you will be fine. Even though he has 200 hit
points, he will go down in a hurry. After you have beaten the Headless
Giant, you have beaten the Cemetery.</p>
<p>Mission complete.</p>

<h4>Mission 5: Ronin Village<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-5-ronin-village" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potion, Blow Gun, Poison Rice</p>
<p>Two months pass after you retrieve the Yoto Swords. Lord Gohda has sent
all of his men to find the Jewel of Heaven before it falls into the hands
of Tenrai, but to no avail. An old sage named Zennosuke, who lives in a red
house in the Ronin Village, is rumored to know the whereabouts of the Jewel
of Heaven. Tenrai’s men also know of this rumor and are already at the ronin
village. You must get to Zennosuke before they do.</p>
<p>This mission is one of the funnest in the game. Take note that enemies
will always follow you onto rooftops on this level so you need to
grapple to places that are too high for them to jump to. You will start
off in the level by a bridge that faces the ronin village. You need to
crouch immediately because there is an enemy near you to your right kind
of and an enemy in front of you on the rooftop of this house. You need
to grapple up onto the roof of the house closest to you when the guy is
no longer looking and the girl on top of it has turned around. There are
lots of enemies in the first part of the level so be cautious.
Throughout this level, you will see women like in the first level and a
funny-looking little man. Do not kill them and try to stay away from
them. You need to move from rooftop to rooftop throughout the courtyard
of this level and stealth kill people. Once you kill everyone in the
area, move towards the northwest side of the level and you will see a
little hole that you can crawl through. Crawl through it and a cut-scene
will commence.</p>
<p>The next area is much like the first. There are several houses and a
small courtyard that is squared off from the other one. When you start
off, you are going to be in water. You need to crouch and walk through
the water. There is going to be a guard straight in front of you so you
need to wait until turns away and slowly get closer and closer and
stealth kill him. Now, move back to where you first entered the level
and turn to your left. Go straight and grapple up onto the wall. There
might be an enemy near so be cautious. Look straight in front of you and
there will be some enemies in the courtyard. You need to go straight
towards the big level of concrete where two guards are standing. One is
going to be walking up and down the left side and one will be walking
left and right on the side where you would have to climb up on. Once
they are both looking away, take out the one closest to you and run and
get the next one. There might be another guy in the courtyard so take
him out too. Once that has been done, look towards the direction where
the big wall is opposite of the direction where you jumped over the
wall. Now, look to your left and go towards that wall. Move out of the
enclosed courtyard and over the wall. Turn right and there will be some
enemies. Take them all out silently and then go straight and enter the
next area.</p>
<p>Now, you will enter an area with a lot of large kegs. Stay on top of the
kegs and scope out all of your enemies. Once you have found all of their
locations, take out each enemy one by one. Once everyone has gone down,
move to the next gate. You will now be in a huge area with lots of
houses and things. Ahead of you is an enemy. Immediately take him out
whenever he is looking away. There are going to be lots of civilians in
this level so make sure not to kill them. Just move throughout the rest
of this area and kill everyone. Move to the northern part of the level
and enter the red house.</p>
<p>There are two boss fights in this level and here comes your first,
Tesshu, who happens to be the secret character in the game that you can
unlock. Tesshu has no weapons except for his fists. Now I know you’re
thinking that this guy should pose no threat, but you are very wrong.
Tesshu is extremely strong and unfortunately for him, he is extremely
slow too. He blocks a lot and seems to attack at every chance he will
get. Just keep blocking and pummeling him with combos and you should do
fine.</p>
<p>Right after you beat Tesshu, you will have to face False Rikimaru. He is
a lot easier than Tesshu was in my opinion. Rikimaru is always on the
offensive and seems to never try to block anything. Just keep blocking
his attacks and doing combos to him. He will be dead before you know it
and the mission will be over.</p>

<h4>Mission 6: Amagai Castle<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-6-amagai-castle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potion, Sticky Bombs, Poison
Rice</p>
<p>You’ve been caught by Kimaira, and you wake up in a cage. As you prepare
for your escape the guard in front of you suddenly shrieks in pain. Tesshu
has followed Kimaira there. After seeing that you can escape by yourself,
Tesshu tells you that Zennosuke mentioned a secret jewel hidden in the eye
of the statue in the Buddha Temple. Then Tesshu disappears.</p>
<p>The mission starts off with a boss fight. You are going to have to fight
Kimaira. When you kill him, you will have 20 minutes to get down to the
bottom of the castle. This is extremely easy to do if you have already
played the game with Rikimaru. Oh well. On to the walkthrough.</p>
<p>This is Dr. Kimaira and his little voodoo statue thing. This guy is kind
of hard because of his moves that you cannot block by pressing Circle
like that spinning kick move he does. At the beginning of the fight,
throw a sticky bomb on him, but don’t detonate it. Start fighting him
and when he goes for the move where he does the spinning kick and is
coming towards you, detonate it. Keep doing combos to him and trying to
dodge his attacks until the fight is over. Use the sticky bomb technique
more than once if you think that it would better your odds of winning.</p>
<p>Now after you beat him, you are at the top of the castle and have to run
to the bottom in under twenty minutes. If you don’t mission failed. The
time limit might as well not even be there. On my first time through the
level, I think I got out in around eight minutes. First, go through the
door in front of you. When you get to the big blades that move up and
down, wait for a second. Those blades will cut your grappling hook wire
if they pass over it so you are going to have to be extra careful. Make
sure there are no guards near you or on the other side that could make
you mess up and take precious aiming for the ceiling below. Wait for the
blades to line up good enough to where you have the best chance of
landing the grapple and making it across. Take your time for you have a
lot of it.</p>
<p>Keep going straight and when you come to the jump that has the gear pit
under the ledge that is very near your location, stop for a second. You
need to position yourself to where you can jump at an angle that would
be kind of to the northeast but diagonally and double jump. Try to guide
your fall to the floor. If you think you can make it, you could try to
double jump straight and just guide your fall from there. Just be very
careful because you will die if you get caught in the gears.</p>
<p>Keep going to the next set of gears. These are a lot easier to jump over
so just double jump straight, but before you do, scope out the enemy on
the ground below. Try to make it to where you can stealth kill him in
the air or if you want, just fight him. Throughout the second floor,
just keep going straight through all of the rooms and going down when
necessary.</p>
<p>When you come to a dead end, you are most likely near the first
revolving door. It is in this dimly lit cell area. Just press R1 near
all of the walls to find the right one, and if a cut-scene commences
showing Ayame having the wall turn, that is the right one. You could
also look at the bottom of the walls for a little gear looking thing
that you would think would be used for it to turn on. After you get this
revolving door down, move down the hallway. There is going to be an
enemy in it by the way. When you get to the end of the hallway, look up
and grapple up.</p>
<p>There is another revolving door somewhere near you. Just go through a
few rooms and when you come to a dead end, put your back against all of
the walls until one works. You will find it. Go through a series of
rooms that are guarded and you will eventually come to a dead end, which
is really the last revolving door. Just look for it and press your back
against walls like the other doors. Keep going straight and you will
eventually come to the end of the level. Now you have a decision. Do you
want to fight Okinage or not? The only thing that this choice affects is
a cut-scene later in the game.</p>
<p>If you do fight him, here is a little walkthrough on how to easily kick
his ass. He is one of the most famous bosses from the Tenchu games. He
has one attack where he will rip at your chest, so stay as far away from
him as possible because this attack is very powerful. Just keep using
your combos on him. If you have unlocked it from the first level, I
suggest using the Shoulder Thrust combo on him. It does wonders. He
drinks a health potion whenever he is about to die so when he is low on
hit points, do not let him have the chance to drink one. Just keep
lobbing him with combos. After you kill him, mission complete. If you
chose not to fight him, you ended the mission right then and there so
mission complete for you too.</p>

<h4>Mission 7: Great Buddha Temple<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-7-great-buddha-temple" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Smoke Bombs, Super Shuriken, Poison
Rice, Health Potion</p>
<p>According to Tesshu, the Jewel of Heaven is hidden in the eye of the
statue inside the Buddha Temple. Ganda, one of Tenrai’s lords of Darkness,
is already at the Buddha Temple with his men. Go to the Buddha Temple,
execute Ganda, and retrieve the Jewel of Heaven.</p>
<p>This mission is a really fun one. It is kind of a stealth kill fest.
Like other of Ayame’s missions, this mission too begins with a boss
fight. This dude is pretty huge too. On to the walkthrough.</p>
<p>You start off and have to fight the Lord of Darkness. This guy is a
giant and is very strong. He blocks almost everything and has very
powerful attacks. I suggest throwing smoke bombs in front of him at
times to confuse him and then attacking. I don’t think you can block
this guy’s attacks so you might as well not even try. This guy is really
slow and Ayame is really fast so you have one thing up on him. When you
think he is going to attack, just get away from him. Keep using combos
on him and using items on him such as the super shuriken and smoke bombs
and you will be fine.</p>
<p>After the Lord of Darkness is dead, you start off inside a cave. There
are two enemies near you. One is in the entrance to the cave and one is
on a little bridge. First, go and watch the guy at the entrance of the
cave. When you think you have a good chance of killing him, go for it.
Now, go take cover behind something so that the other guy will not see
you when he comes and inspects the dead body because he will. After he
stays in purple mode for a while and then goes back to not caring, go
and stealth kill him when you get the chance. Then, run to the little
wooden bridge with the poles sticking out of the wall. You will see
three big wooden plank things sticking out of the wall. Grapple up to
the middle one and go through the crawl space.</p>
<p>When you come out, you will be in a lower level with an enemy inside the
cave to your right and an enemy in front of you. You need to crouch down
to avoid being seen. When he turns away, go and kill him. Now, turn
around and go back onto the lower level. Now, turn to your left and run.
There is a little drop in front of you so you need to jump over it onto
the boards across from you. Turn around after getting onto it and use
the manual camera to look down at the level below. There is a guard
there so when he walks the other way, jump down and kill him. When done,
grapple back up. Press your back against the cave wall. Look to your
left for an enemy that walks up and down that little path. When he is
walking away, jump out and kill him. Now, keep going straight and go up
the stairs, but do not enter the next room. While on the stairs, press
against the wall on your right. You need to look for a guy to turn
around and walk the other way. When he does, kill him. Then, go to the
ledge that has a drop into the next room. There is a guy in front of you
and a guy to the right. You need to sneak around and kill the guy to the
right. It doesn’t matter if he sees you or not. Just kill him either
way. Next, go take care of the other one when he turns around.</p>
<p>Now go straight. Jump onto the planks and eventually, onto the ground
below. Kill the bear with a stealth kill because this is probably harder
than most of the bosses in the game. This thing has 250 hit points and
is very hard to kill. If you don’t stealth kill it, I suggest retreating
until they no longer think you are there. Stealth kill all of the guys
in that area. After that, go back to the part where the bear was and
look up. You need to grapple up onto the big bars above. Eventually,
make your way to the ledge above. There is a guy there with a blowgun
that you will have to kill. Press your back against the column and wait
for him to walk to the right. When he does, kill him.</p>
<p>Go towards the grayish cave and look up since it is a dead end. There
will be a ledge there to grapple to. Grapple up to it. You come to a
large area with a platform below and above you. Jump to the one below
and get the item. Now, grapple up to the other one and go along the
plank and kill the guard. Now, grapple up to the next walkway. There is
a pit in front of you. Hook the grappling hook to the roof above the
floor and immediately turn to the right and kill that guard. Then, turn
around and turn right.</p>
<p>Jump over the pit and then fall in the next hole. This is the way to go.
In the next room, there is going to be a huge pit. When you get in, jump
to the side of the room. Then, jump on the plank that is right by the
side. Then, jump to the side of the room again. You are going to come to
a similar looking room. Use the grappling hook to get from side to side.
When you get all the way to the end of the pit and on the side, it looks
like a dead end, but there is a column that you can grapple up to above
you. It may take a few tries, but you will eventually get it.</p>
<p>Once you are on it, look up and keep grappling up a lot. You have
arrived at the top when you see wooden walls with red trim. Once you’re
inside, keep going straight and watching your Ki meter. When you get to
the main room, use your grappling hook to climb up to the right side of
the statue. Once you do this, you have completed the mission and a cut-
scene will commence.</p>

<h4>Mission 8: Limestone Caverns<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-8-limestone-caverns" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potion, Blow Gun, Poison Rice</p>
<p>With two of the three jewels in the possession of Tenrai, Lord Gohda
decides that his only chance of winning is to conduct a surprise attack.
Gohda’s men are sent across the land to find out where Tenrai is hiding.
After a few days, the men gather information that Tenrai has set up a
fortress on a nearby island. Any boats would be spotted easily, but a
surprise attack could be conducted through a tunnel within
the Limestone Cavern that connects the island to the mainland. During the
process of gaining this information, Gohda loses half of his army, and
Sekiya, his advising counsel, is taken hostage by the enemy within the
Limestone Cavern. You must go to the Limestone Cavern and rescue Sekiya.
Princess Kiku, lord Gohda’s daughter, hands over her sister’s bells for
good luck.</p>
<p>In the room you start off in, there is only one enemy. Kill him when you
get a chance. Move through the cave opening now. Keep moving through
until you see another enemy. When he moves out of sight, run and kill
him. Keep going straight until you get to a sloped part of your path.
There is a pitfall and an enemy ahead of you. If you fall in a pit, you
will instantly die. When you do, hold down R1 so you can crouch and keep
walking forward. Get up close to the wall, but do not press your back
against it. When you get confident enough, jump over the pit and near
the enemy. Press square before landing for a sure stealth kill. Next,
keep going straight. You will come to an area with 3 enemies, one below
you, one in a cave, and one way up high on a ledge. I suggest killing
the one below you with a blowgun. Now, try to stay away from the one by
the cave. Grapple up to the ledge above and move across it until you see
the feet of the enemy. When they turn away, jump up and stealth kill
them.</p>
<p>Turn to your right and there will be yet another enemy in front of you.
Wait for them to start walking away and they are out of sight. Run
towards the spot where they were and jump over the pit. They will most
likely be walking back toward you now so drop down into the pit. This
actually isn’t a pit, but more of a hole because it has a bottom to it.
Hang onto it until the guy starts walking again and stealth kill him.
Jump back down into the hole and walk straight. You will eventually come
to a big wooden bridge. There is an enemy there on your left so press up
against the wall and wait for them to turn away. When they do, stealth
kill them.</p>
<p>Now, walk back towards the part where you first got on the bridge. You
have to actually walk off of the end of the bridge. This is a long drop,
but there is ground below and it is the way to go. Now, walk towards the
next cave and wait for the enemy there to turn around. When he does,
kill him. See that cell? Go up to it and release Sekiya. Now we must get
some explosives. Go straight and when you get to an area that has some
large kegs that prevent a crawlspace, move up and stealth kill the
guard. Then, move the kegs and go get the explosives. Now, keep going
straight. You will come to a big room with a lot of water and stuff
everywhere eventually. When you do, creep through it and go to the path
on the left. Kill any enemy you see. Keep looking up for a big walkway.
When you see it, grapple up to it. Follow it to the next area. Kill the
enemy here. When you arrived, look in the direction that is to the right
of that. See that big boulder? Just go up to it, place the explosives,
and run.</p>
<p>Time for a boss fight. This is Kagura and Spirit Wolf. They are rather
easy. You just have to keep clear of Spirit Wolf and always go and try
to attack Kagura. If you have any, try some sticky bombs. These work
well. If you get tired of Spirit Wolf attacking you, kick his ass. After
you kill Kagura, the mission is over. Note that Spirit Wolf is not
required to be killed.</p>

<p>After the battle with Kagura, you return to lord Gohda to report the
situation regarding the tunnel and Sekiya. Lord Gohda thanks you for your
courage and decides to hold a strategy meeting with his men. He returns
a few hours later. The plan is to send you in to kill the leader from the
inside. You must infiltrate the fortress and eradicate the enemies from within.</p>
<p>This mission is very tough. There are lots of dangers in this level. The
enemies seem like they are tougher and there are loads of pitfalls.
There are Monks, undeads, and jonins throughout this level.</p>
<p>In the first area, just scan it for jonins and stealth kill anyone you
see. Move on to the area with the big log. Move across the log halfway.
Scan the area below for all of the enemies and watch the ways they move.
Then, jump down to the roof of the house below. Whenever you think you
have the best chance, stealth kill one of the enemies and quickly take
care of the other one. If you need to, you can always jump back onto the
roof after killing one and wait for the other again. There is a health
potion on the far side of the building so get it. When everyone is gone,
go around the corner. You should always keep an eye on your Ki meter and
stealth kill all of the enemies that you come in contact with, but I’m
pretty sure you know that already. Keep going until you reach a very
large room.</p>
<p>This room has a lot of enemies in it and it will be pretty hard to make
your way around it and stealth kill them all, but it is for the best
considering that they are extremely hard to fight since they are so
strong and they will have other enemies to come and help them. The
room’s exit is on the far right side. Just kill all of the enemies and
make your way to that part. Ok I will give you a strategy on the guard
near the exit. He is standing right by it and will almost never move.
What you need to do is, grapple up to the wall along the side of the
cave that is to the enemy’s left. Then, press your back against the wall
and slowly creep towards him. When he looks to his right a little, go
out and stay close to the wall. Run and kill him with a stealth kill.</p>
<p>Now, go through the opening and climb the stairs. These next few rooms
contain large guns that overlook the fortress’s outside compound and the
areas have lots of enemies. Keep going through the gun rooms and stealth
killing all of the enemies. In the next gun room, you need to look for
an area above you that you can grapple to. When you see it, grapple up.
There will be a monk in front of you so wait until he turns. When he
does, take him out. Then move to the left side of the platform. Find the
small wooden bridge on the left side and go on it. Continue through the
corridors and stealth kill any enemies that get in your way. Continue
through the rooms until you reach a room with a female guard in the
bottom of it. Use a blowgun to take her out, and then move up the step-
like stones. There is a jonin at the top of one of the steps so you need
to kill him when you get the chance.</p>
<p>After you do, search the area for the top of a guard tower. Jump onto it
or leap to the area below it. Continue in the only direction possible
until the boss chamber. You are about to face Tatsumaru, who in my
opinion, is one of the hardest bosses of the game. Tatsumaru is fast,
but Ayame is faster so use that to your advantage. I suggest throwing
sticky bombs on him and detonating them if you want to make this much
easier. Try to not stay too close to him and block anything he throws at
you. Just keep using your combos and or items to your advantage. When he
is dead, you have won.</p>

<h4>Mission 10: Tenrai’s Fortress Part 2<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-10-tenrai-s-fortress-part-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Ninja Rebirth, Healing Potions,
Invisibility Spell, Kasumi and Shizuku</p>
<p>Here it is, the last mission in Ayame’s campaign. This mission, in my
opinion, is actually easier than Part 1 of Tenrai’s Fortress. We will
see I guess. On to the walkthrough.</p>
<p>When you start out, immediately grapple up to the ledge above you. As
you did in the last mission, you need to move through all of the
hallways and kill any enemies that you come in contact with. Keep an eye
on your Ki meter as it will help you a lot in this fight. Keep going to
an area where there are multiple pathways. All of the paths lead to the
same place, but they are slightly different. Just pick one and move
through it, killing anyone you see. After patrolling the maze, you come
to the exit of this level. Jump to the raised doorway. There are lots of
female ninja guards so keep a look out for them.</p>
<p>Keep going until you come to a room with several large pillars in it.
Use the grappling hook to reach the first pillar. Then, look around for
an opening in the wall that has an item in it. Jump into it get it.
Then, jump back onto the first pillar. Grapple up to the other ones and
then grapple to the ledge that will let you keep progressing in the
level. The next room contains pillars that you have to jump onto. One
false step and you will fall to your death. Jump from pillar to pillar
and eventually, to the ledge by the wall in front of you. If you want,
you could always use the grappling hook instead of making the last jump
because it is more of a sure thing. Now, walk down the walkway until you
see a jonin. When you do, time yourself right and eventually kill him.</p>
<p>Move around the room and go up the steps, step by step. The next room is
a grid that contains a lot of enemies. You should use your Ki meter a
lot here. When you get to the staircase, look up and grapple up. Now,
grapple up again to the ledge above. Go up the staircase and eventually,
you will see an enemy and a gap in the staircase. Try to take him out
with a blowgun or a stick bomb or something because you don’t want to
have to fight him on such a narrow strip. If you have to fight him,
proceed with caution. After he is dead, climb up onto the walkway above.
Look to your left and grapple to that side. Kill the guard right by you.
Then, go along the walkway and look down. You should see a big drop with
an area you can drop to with an item. Drop down and get it. Next, look
up the wall to your left. Grapple up to the ledge above. Just keep
grappling and jumping around until you get to Tenrai. You should have no
further problems until you get to him.</p>
<p>Now you are up to the final boss of the game, Tenrai. He has three
phases. Each phase is stronger than the last. First up is his weakest
phase that has 150 hit points. I suggest using the Exploding Arrows or
Sticky Bombs on him, but don’t use too many. Save some for later phases.
In the first phase, he will have several long range and short range
attacks. Just keep him locked-on and move around a lot. Use combos to
him whenever you feel you have a good chance. After he is dead, here
comes the second phase. The second phase is a lot harder and has 200 hit
points. Your hits at first will seem as if they are not doing any
damage, but after a while, there will be a cut-scene and then they will
start to. He seems to block a lot now, but just keep trying to do combos
and eventually you will kill him. Use the same techniques as the first
phase. Here comes the third phase along with it’s 200 hit points. The
third phase is probably the easiest. Just keep using the same techniques
as the first and second phase and you will win eventually.</p>

<h4>Mission 1: Echigoya<a class="headerlink" href="#id17" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potion, Smoke Bomb, Throwing
Needle</p>
<p>When the law fails to serve justice, one can buy justice. Underground
groups offer assassinations at reasonable prices, but they only take
on missions that they agree will serve justice. This is the story of
Tesshu Fujioka, a doctor by day, a hired assassin by night. It’s a
warm spring evening when Tesshu is ordered to murder Nasu and Echigoya.
Both are guilty of kidnapping village girls and selling them as slaves
to neighboring states. The families of the daughters feel that the
officials won’t punish Nasu because he’s a high-ranking statesman. Both
Nasu and Echigoya must die.</p>
<p>You start off on the ground outside of the compound. First, select your
Grappling Hook and grapple onto the wall in front of you. Once you get
on it, run to the right and then go straight. Keep running along the
wall until you come to the northeast corner of the level. Jump down onto
the concrete and pick up the white ball, which is a smoke bomb. Now, get
back onto the wall. Go straight towards the northwest corner of the
level. When you get there, there is going to be a guard on the ground
and a guard above you. Get all the way up against the wall and wait for
the guard on the ground to look away. Immediately jump down and stealth
kill him. Then, grapple up to the ledge where the other guard is
standing. When he is facing away from you, get up there and stealth kill
him. Now, go straight towards the southwestern part of the level. There
are going to be guards all around the courtyard so just silently take
them all out. After you have, look around the main building for a place
with a door. There will be a beehive by the door so that will help you
find it. Once you do, go up to it and go through it. Go through the
doors and you will eventually find a little hole in the wall. You can go
through it so hold R1 and go through. Here comes a loading screen.</p>
<p>Peek out of the door a little of the shack that you end up coming out
of. Look to your left. There will be a guard lying down on a blanket. Go
up behind him and kill him, but make sure there is no one else around
first. Take out anyone else in the courtyard. Now, look around for a
part of the fence where there is no barbed wire. You need to climb over
it. Run all the way to the right side of the non-barbed wire fence. Look
for guys around there to kill. You see that huge house in front of you?
You need to get to the other side of it so hop on the roof and walk over
it and drop down on the other side after making sure there are no guards
around. Look for the door all the way on the right on that side of the
building.</p>
<p>Once you are inside, we have to start looking for a key. Turn on your
map. You need to get to the room all the way on the lower-left corner of
the map. Kill the guy in there and get the key. Next, go through rooms
and killing people. Just do the normal routine until you get to the
locked door. Unlock it with the key and make your way to the basement.
Grapple up to the room that leads to the staircase and keep going
straight. Go up the staircase when you reach it. Keep going from room to
room doing the normal routine, watch the Ki meter and kill. When you get
to a room with a cat, get in Stealth mode and get as far away from it as
possible. Go past it and go through the crawl space. Now, grapple up to
the wooden ledge above at the end of that room. Now, just make your way
to Nasu. Just keep going straight and you will reach him. Kill anyone
that crosses your path.</p>
<p>Once you enter the battle, immediately try to kill the ronins. I suggest
throwing a smoke bomb down to confuse them. Now, just kick their asses.
Keep using combos and keep as far away from Nasu as possible. Once you
kill them, go for Nasu. After beating him to death for a while, he might
try to give up or something. If he does, do not approach him. Try to get
close, but not close enough for him to attack. Immediately start
pummeling him and after a while, he will go down. Just keep using the
same maneuvers over and over. Combo after combo will get you victory.</p>

<h4>Mission 2: Gohda’s Castle<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-2-gohda-s-castle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potion, Blow Gun, Throwing
Needle</p>
<p>Nasu was killed by another assassin. This truly bothers Tesshu. He
doesn’t sleep well that night. Tesshu’s curiosity about Gohda’s Ninja’s
escalates because Zennosuke keeps telling him to forget about it. He
says that crossing swords with the Azuma is the same as suicide.
But Tesshu is still angry that he couldn’t collect his fee because
Rikimaru got to his target first. Ignoring Zennosuke’s advice, Tesshu
sneaks into Gohda’s Castle to find Rikimaru and prove to himself that he
is the better assassin.</p>
<p>In the next mission, you are going to want to get the most number of
stealth kills possible. It will really help you in this mission to stay
hidden from your enemy. Just use as much stealth as you can and you will
do fine. Keep an eye on your Ki meter throughout the duration of this
mission.</p>
<p>If you have already played through the game with Rikimaru, go to the
room where Rikimaru killed Hamada (asking since you might have used
cheats). It is the long room on the right side of the map. If you
haven’t already played with him but played with Ayame, get to the part
of the level where there is concrete on the ground and there is a
hallway that you can enter in front of you and to the right of you. It
is almost near the starting point of the level. After getting there, get
in position where you can see a hallway in front of you and to the
right. Take the one to the right and keep going straight. Keep on the
right side of the hall so a door will open when you near it. This is the
door to go in. When you get inside, go through the secret door. Just
look for it and you will see it after a minute.</p>
<p>When you come out, you will end up near a staircase that leads to the
second level of the level. Move through the two rooms, kill the guard by
the staircase, and go up the stairs. Remember the part of the level
where you were supposed to go to end the level to fight Hamada as Ayame?
Well, you need to get to that room. Just keep going through the rooms
and stealth killing. You should have no problem at all of finding it
because it is a very straight-on path. If you get lost, consult the map.
The room you are looking far is on the opposite side of the map from
where you entered the second level.</p>
<p>After you get to the room, a boss fight will commence. You have to fight
Rikimaru. Rikimaru is pretty easy in my opinion. He is faster than
Tesshu, but not as strong. Just keep blocking his attacks and using
combos on him. You will eventually kill him. The fight will end when
Rikimaru gets down to 50 hit points so it won’t be that hard. Just watch
out for his leg sweep. That could mess you up. If you see him going for
it, try to move out of the way. Oh and one more thing, smoke bombs are
extremely effective on Rikimaru. If you have any, throw some down and
then start pummeling him with attacks. Soon, the fight will be over.</p>

<h4>Mission 3: Buddha Temple<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-3-buddha-temple" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Strength Potion, Healing Potion,
Throwing Needle, Blow Gun</p>
<p>Six months after Tesshu’s failure to kill Nasu, he takes on a new mission.
He’s hired to kill Ganda, the head of a new religious cult that has taken
over the Buddha Temple on the border of Gohda’s realm. Ganda took part in
the plan to sell village girls to neighboring states as slaves, but he
escaped justice because of his religious profession.</p>
<p>Like when you played through this mission with Ayame, this mission
begins with a boss fight. You have to fight Ganda, who is a freaking
giant. This dude is huge. Anyways, he can be as bad as he looks. Attacks
don’t seem to take as much off of him as they would on other people. He
also happens to have 200 hit points, which doesn’t help you that much.</p>
<p>This guy is terribly slow. He is even slower than Tesshu. When he is
about to attack you, you can usually tell so you need to try to run in
the opposite direction because he has a large attack range because of
his long arms and legs. When he attacks, just move away and then hurry
back and pummel him with hits. Smoke bombs are very effective on him if
you have any. I don’t think you can actually block this guy’s attacks so
you might as well not even try. Just keep using the method I said about
when he is going to attack and beating the hell out of him with combos.
It might take a healing potion to help you with your cause, but he will
soon be dead. After he is, time for the level to begin.</p>
<p>Move from the scaffolding to the walkway, and go through all of the
corridors. This doesn’t actually lead to a way out, but it helps with
stealth kills. Keep killing guys and watching your Ki meter. Try not to
get into any one-on-one fights because this will cause other guards to
come and help. Anyways, keep going until you drop down to the main
floor, which isn’t too far ahead. Just keep going straight. Run around
the right side of the statue to find the way out of this area. Now you
are about to be outside, but beware, there is a big ass bear just
waiting to gnaw you to death. Do your best not to alert it. If you do,
run as fast as you can. Eventually make your way to the exit and kill
the guard by it. Drop down there.</p>
<p>Any enemies that are still alive from the last area will follow you and
this includes the bear so do not waste time. Keep moving. When you come
to the big pit with only a board at the bottom, turn around and look up
for a place to grapple to. It will be tricky to get up there, but that
is the way to go. After getting out of there, go into the temple area.
Kill the guy near you and grapple up to the beams above you. Keep
continuing. You are going to come to another pit. Jump from side to side
of it until you come to the edge of it. Then, use your grappling hook to
get on top of a tall pillar. Now move into the next room. There is going
to be a wooden bridge somewhere in there. Jump over to it and kill the
guy that you are going to have to fight. Then, grapple back up to the
place where you jumped. Look for a way out at the top and then grapple
when you see it.  The next room is going to have a lot of bridges on a
pit. Jump down there and kill the guard. To your right will be the exit
and go.</p>

<h4>Mission 4: Limestone Caverns<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-4-limestone-caverns" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Healing Potion, Smoke Bomb, Throwing
Needle</p>
<p>Tesshu is very surprised to see Jinnai, a former member of Muzen, the same
underground organization that Tesshu belongs to. When Tesshu wakes up, he
is in a prison cell. All of his tools for his midnight job have been
confiscated. Tesshu must get his tools and escape.</p>
<p>Tesshu is about to spend a while in a cell. He gets locked up and loses
all of his items. He is going to bust out and you have to recover them
and then leave the caverns. This is going to be a rather easy mission
compared to the last one and the ones ahead of this. All of the items
are in these little cell and they have a good amount of guards around
it. Don’t worry though. Just keep an eye on that Ki meter.</p>
<p>You are going to start out in a cell with a guard just a few feet from
you. Press your back against the wall and when you think the time is
right, circle it and run and kill the guard. Now, we need to look at the
map so press Select. Look for little red dots. Those are your missing
items that you need to get. They are pretty close and they are in a cell
like the one that you were in. Go towards the first one. It is going to
be by a crawlspace by a bunch of barrels. You need to kill the enemies
around the cell and then go get it. That was the only thing you had to
get.</p>
<p>Now pull up the map again. You need to get to the exit of the caverns.
The exit is in the room at the upper-right corner of the map. It should
be very easy to get there since you are going in a straight line after
all. Keep going until you get to the room with a lot of water everywhere
and has the risen walkway. There are going to be a lot of ninjas in
there so be ready. I suggest shooting them with the blowgun or you could
just try to kill them yourself. Either way, you need to get on top of
that risen walkway in that room. When you do, just follow it to the
exit.</p>

<p>A cold shiver goes down Tesshu’s spine. It’s intuition, a gut feeling that
something truly bad is about to happen. Tesshu hates himself for feeling
these things in advance. He must hurry to the hut in the Cemetery, because
Senkichi is waiting there to pay him for his services.</p>
<p>Unlike the time that you had to play through this mission with Rikimaru
and Ayame, you have no undead foes. Everyone is alive and out to kill
you. There are lots of enemies on this level and you should keep an eye
on your Ki meter at all times for it will save your life.</p>
<p>At the starting point, just move down towards the first passageway and
keep an eye on your Ki meter like I said in the above paragraph. Enter
the first passageway and make your way through it and doing business as
usual. Just kill and keep an eye on the Ki. Eventually, make your way to
the Blood Room. When you get there, look down there for a jonin. You
need to kill him with a blowgun dart if possible because he is going to
go kamikaze on you if he sees you. He has his pockets loaded with
grenades and wants to die. Just try not to get in contact with him.</p>
<p>After you kill him, exit the Blood Room by going to the other end of it
and grappling out. There is going to be a jonin right at your hands when
you are hanging from the ledge of the exit from the Blood Room so be
ready. He won’t try to blow himself up though so don’t worry. Just get
up there and kill him. After you do, keep going until you exit the
passageway. You need to go through here and jump over a fence to the
other side. Just look for the fence and kill everyone that crosses your
path. After you jump over it, move through the area to the next
passageway. Just go straight through this set of passageways and kill
anyone you see. Stop when you come to the exit of the passageway.</p>
<p>There are three guards out here. You can easily kill them all without a
fuss. Just go and kill them. Make your way to the next passageways. Keep
going until you get to a dead end and look up. There should be a hole
there. Grapple out of it. When you get up, look for a hut and run to the
front of it. That is the end of this mission.</p>

<p>Recommended Items To Bring Along: Blow Gun, Smoke Bomb, Disguise, Health
Potions</p>
<p>Senkichi is dead. Tesshu knows that it had to be Jinnai, the only one who
knew about the secret handoff point for payment. Zennosuke will know what
to do. Tesshu rushes to the Ronin Village to meet with him. The village is
infested with Jinnai’s men.</p>
<p>This is Tesshu’s final mission. You are on your way to find the end boss
so be ready. This mission is full of enemies and it is a lot of fun to
kill them all. This is the funnest mission for Tesshu probably. You will
have a stealth kill fest. Have fun.</p>
<p>You are going to begin at the gate of the Amagai Castle. Turn left. See
that building? You need to get on the other side of it and enter it to
talk to Zennosuke. That is your objective for now. Just kill any guy
that poses a threat to you that is in front of the house and then go in.
After the cut-scene, you need to get to the door that leads to the next
area. It is at the other side of the map from the house and is on risen
land. Just make your way to it and stealth kill anyone that poses a
threat to you.</p>
<p>Now you are in the Keg Area. You don’t actually have to kill anyone in
this area, but you could if you want. If you don’t want to, just hop
from keg to keg until you get to the exit and go through the next gate.
If you do, just be careful and make your way to the gate after. From
here, go straight. You need to kill all of the enemies on your way too.
Go straight until you reach some water. Then, follow the water to a
crawlspace that would have been on the opposite side of the map from
you. If someone is chasing you, do not enter the crawlspace or they will
blow you up.</p>
<p>Now you are in the final area. You need to go look for Ukyo who is
leaning up against a hut or something. He is a Chinese guy with a big
hat on and he looks like someone that you would see in some old Chinese
movies. Approach him to start the final battle of Tesshu’s campaign.
This guy is pretty tough. He is very quick and powerful. He blocks a lot
and is very hard to hit. He also has a really long stick so that means
that he has a large striking range. Blocking will be your best friend in
this fight. Just take your time and block, hit, block, hit, and
etcetera. This is how you will win this fight. If you still have some, I
suggest using your smoke bombs to distract him.</p>

<p>Now, turn left and go straight. After like 2 steps, a cut scene will
commence showing a burning tower-like thing fall. Don’t pay attention to
it. Keep going straight and you should be in between a wall and a
building. Keep going straight but go very slowly for you will meet your
first enemy ahead. When at the opening, look around the corner and there
will be a yellowish looking dog. When it is turned around, run and press
Attack near it. This will get you your first stealth kill! Now turn
around. You should be facing the wall.</p>
<p>See that red box over by the wooden planks stacked against the wall? Go
over to it and pick it up. This will give you invisibility for a while.
Now, turn back around and go towards that big wooden box near a
building. Get the red thing by it. This is more healing potion. Now use
your grapple hook by picking the item farthest to your right in your
inventory like thing on the screen. When selected, hold triangle and
point it towards the white building directly across from the box and
point the grapple towards the roof.</p>
<p>When it is on the roof, let go of triangle and let the grapple beam hook
on. This will cause you to fly on top of the roof. Now, get the red box
in the middle of the roof and now you have sticky bombs. Now, turn
around and hop down from there onto the ground below. See that big box
again? Well, hop onto it and then onto the roof of the house right by
it. Continue walking down the roof until you get to a guard. When he is
turned around, hop off and press attack.</p>
<p>If he didn’t see you, this will cause you to do a stealth attack. Now,
turn to your right and you should see a ramp. Go up it but do not go all
the way up for there is a guard up there and he cannot see you. Press
against the wall by the ramp and when the guy turns around, quickly jump
up to ground level and go and stealth attack him when close by pressing
R1 and Square. Now, walk over him to pick up his spear. After that, walk
off of the edge of the ground and go straight.</p>
<p>You should be in between two buildings. Go through them and drop down to
the ground below. Look near the red house and you should see a guard and
an unarmed man. When the guard and the unarmed man are both turned,
quickly run to the guard and kill him. Now go for the unarmed man. Now,
keep going straight where you killed the unarmed man and you should see
a big hill like thing that you can go up. There is a guy with a bow and
arrow up there. You need to climb onto the edge of it and wait for him
to turn around. When he does, kill him and take the bow and arrow. Now
you have a bow and arrow!</p>
<p>Now, go back towards the building where you killed your first human.
When you are in front of it and are near where the first guard you
killed was standing, turn and look at the courtyard where the unarmed
man and the guard were. Jump down onto the ground below and you should
see some vase looking things around there. Break them and get the item
there. It is more healing potion. Now, go towards that red thing by that
building in front of you and break the vases there and get that pick-up.
Now head back to that red house in the courtyard. Go towards the door
and a cut scene will commence.</p>
<p>After it, you will need to take care of two guards that are charging
after you. Hurry and kill them with sword combos and such. After that,
here comes the boss fight! The boss is a guy wearing red and has a sword
and a gun. You need to avoid the sword as much as possible. Just keep
doing sword combos on him and he will eventually die. If you need more
health, just use the healing potion. Congratulations for you have beaten
the demo!</p>

<h4>Bonus Mission: Through The Portal<a class="headerlink" href="#bonus-mission-through-the-portal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As the castle collapses, the only way to escape is to jump into the
portal that Meioh flees into. Inside the portal is another universe - a
world in which a large biotech pharmaceutical company has created a deadly
disease and sold the cure at a substantial profit. Many civilians couldn’t
afford the cure and died. The government’s auditing of the company’s
accounting procedures led to the unveiling of a huge fraud, but the
CEO bribed his way out of jail. You must punish this evil CEO!</p>
<p>Through The Portal takes place in the future. The point of the mission?
You are supposed to kill an evil CEO of a pharmaceuticals corporation
who got people sick or something just so he could sell them the
antidote. The level is flooded with guards and stuff that are cops.
Well, on to the walkthrough.</p>
<p>Go straight a little and peek to the left around a wall. You should see
a guard. When he starts to walk up the stairs, run over to him and kill
him. After you have, run back down the stairs. At the feet of the
stairs, turn left and walk straight. When you see a ledge on your left
side, grapple up to it, but do not climb up. There will most likely be a
guard there. If not, go up and hug the wall on the left and peek around
the corner to watch the guard. Kill him whenever you think you have the
best chance.</p>
<p>After that, go straight. There is going to be a guard near the entrance
of this door so be cautious. When he turns around, kill him. Look in
front of you and you should see a small walkway by a bunch of machines
and pipes. Go in it a little and peek to the right. There will be a
guard there that is walking up and down a walkway. When you think you
have the best chance, stealth kill him. Now, go out the door and get on
the walkway. Look to your left after you get on it and there will be a
guard. Kill him any way that you can. Then, turn and go the other way.
Once you start nearing a fence, look to the left and up and you should
see a ledge. Grapple up to it and then walk to where you have passed the
fence.</p>
<p>There will be a guard down there. Jump on the risen walkway above him
and when you get the chance to, take him out. Next, go to the next fence
and face the wall on the right. Grapple up to the ledge above you. Look
around up there for a crawlspace and go through it. In the next area,
there are three cops. When you enter it, turn to the left to where you
are seeing the long part of the room. Now I can tell you the guard
locations. There is one walking around in the middle, one to the right
of the room near a pillar and carrying a gun, and one that is walking
from left to right way in front of you.</p>
<p>Above you is a walkway. I suggest grappling up to it and jumping down on
each enemy one at a time and repeating the process. This is the easiest
way to do this. If you don’t want to, you really don’t have to kill
them. Anyway, after you kill them all, get on the walkway above you and
follow it to the crawlspace and go through it. When you come out, there
will be a guard right by you so stealth kill him right when you see him.</p>
<p>Follow the hall to the elevators and kill the guards by them. Go in the
elevator on the right. When you get to the next floor, kill the guard
that is walking up and down the hall. After that, enter the doors. Here
is the boss fight. The evil CEO is your enemy here. This guy is pretty
damn hard and very strong. He is packing 250 hit points. He blocks a lot
and seems near impossible to hit. He has a lot of powerful attacks too.
Don’t get too close to him and always be ready to dodge and block
things. When you get the chance, go in for combos. If you still have any
caltrops left, run away from the CEO and drop them. Keep running and he
will follow you. When he steps on the caltrops, go in for a combo. This
is a pretty effective method for defeating him. When you kill him, you
win.</p>

not going anywhere by foot. Make your way through the level by
going from rooftop to rooftop. Also, have you and your friend split
up. Then, just go around the level and pick up all of the scrolls.
Also, enemies can pick up more than one scroll. Use your map to

another hit. You need to fight through all of the enemies and get to him.
Then, you have to save him and escort him to the safe area.</p>
<p>The best strategy to use is to have one player stay with Lord Gohda at
all times and fight anyone that comes. Then, have the other player
run ahead and clear the path of enemies. Sure this won’t be as fun
for one player so just switch turns.</p>
<p>There are archers that are hiding behind fences that will fire
at Lord Gohda. Have the guy that is clearing the path go and kill
them all. Have the guy that is staying with Lord Gohda take care
of the rest of the baddies. After you get to the safe area, you are
done.</p>

<h4>Mission 3: Castle<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-3-castle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This mission can be very hard if you are playing with someone who
likes to fight and doesn’t take their time when progressing through
levels. You have to stealth kill everyone in this level. If you
get seen even once, the mission is failed.</p>
<p>Some of the areas might require you to kill two enemies that are
very close to each other and would be impossible to do with just
one person. If so, just take your time and both of you kill them
when you both agree that you have a good chance of making the kills.
You need to just go through the level and get to the end to beat it.
After that, you are done.</p>
<p>Mission complete.</p>

<div class="section" id="mission-4-cavern">
<h4>Mission 4: Cavern<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-4-cavern" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>You need to get 240 points to beat this level. You get points for doing
things like stealth kills, regular kills, and more. The best thing to
do is to travel together and get double stealth kills, which will give
you more points. If you do not meet the required number of points, you
fail the mission. Just get the number of points in the amount of time
and you are done.</p>

<h4>Mission 5: Fortress Of Evil A<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-5-fortress-of-evil-a" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This mission is like a big battle royale. You need to make your way
through the level and just kill everyone in your path. The point is to
kill everyone. Do not leave one enemy behind. You and your friend need
to travel together though because the enemies will gang up on you in
groups and double team you. Just make your way to the end of the level
and you win.</p>
<p>Mission complete.</p>

<h4>Mission 6: Fortress Of Evil B<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-6-fortress-of-evil-b" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This mission is pretty tough. It takes place in one huge room and you
have to fight bosses from all of the levels. You have to fight 2 at
a time. I suggest for you to have one character lead a boss to one side
of the room and the other player lead the other one to the other side.
This will be a lot easier for you in my opinion. After you beat each
round, you are done.</p>

<h4>Co-Op Tips<a class="headerlink" href="#co-op-tips" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>I am now going to list some tips for co-op.</p>
<div class="section" id="talk">
<h5>Talk<a class="headerlink" href="#talk" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>You guys are sitting right next to each other. You need to talk your
way through levels. You need to discuss things before you do something.
If one person does not agree on doing something just yet, you probably
shouldn’t do it. Just take your time and discuss things. If one person
needs help with something, go and help them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id19">
<h5>Dual Stealth Kills<a class="headerlink" href="#id19" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>A dual stealth kill is given when both characters stealth kill the same
guy. To do this, have one person go and press Square for the stealth kill
and have the other player be within 10 feet of them. I think you should
try to do this as often as possible because it gives you lots of points
and it looks cool.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="help">
<h5>Help<a class="headerlink" href="#help" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>You should always watch your friend’s screen. When it seems as if he
might get into some combat and need help because people are ganging
up on him, you should go and help him. This will decrease their
chance of dying and help your chances of winning the mission.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="roles">
<h5>Roles<a class="headerlink" href="#roles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>You should always know your role in a mission. One person needs to do
something and the other needs to do something else. I don’t think you
should always try to walk together in missions because it is much
easier if you aren’t together.</p>

<h4>Mission 1: Village<a class="headerlink" href="#id20" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In this level, you have to fight computer enemies to get to the other
player. When you get to them, just fight them. The level is the first
part of the Ronin Village and there are enemies scattered all over the
place.</p>
<p>I suggest getting on a rooftop and watching out for the other
player. Try not to kill the computer enemies if you don’t have to and
let them take life off of your friend. After that, just fight your
friend to the best of your ability and you will most likely win
this battle.</p>

<h4>Versus Tips<a class="headerlink" href="#id25" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>I am just going to list some tips on killing your friend, well, enemy
in this section.</p>
<div class="section" id="map">
<h5>Map<a class="headerlink" href="#map" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>You can see your enemy’s location on the map that you can pull up by
pressing Select at all times. Right when the mission starts, you can
hurry up and pull up the map to get their location. If you have an
Exploding Arrow handy then, you can just turn in their direction and
fire. This will give you a leg up in the fights.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="health">
<h5>Health<a class="headerlink" href="#health" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>You should watch your health meter at all times. I suggest to only
use health potions when your health is at 30 hit points or below.
Because you both have the same amount of health and health potions,
health potion use can make a difference in who is going to win
the level or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id26">
<h5>Wrath of Heaven<a class="headerlink" href="#id26" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>If you have this ability unlocked, I suggest to almost never use it.
If you do want to use it, it will instantly kill the other player.
Since it leaves you with only one hit point left, you must land it
on the first try or the other player can hit you and kill you. Just
try to align it correctly and use it with caution. If you aren’t
too skilled with using the ability, I suggest not to use it at all
throughout the versus games.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cheating">
<h5>Cheating<a class="headerlink" href="#cheating" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>You should always watch your enemy’s screen. This will give you a
sense of where they are and how they are playing the game. Sure it
is cheating, but if you want to win very badly, this is the way
to do it. Cheat at the best of your ability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rooftops">
<h5>Rooftops<a class="headerlink" href="#rooftops" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Rooftops are always important because you can keep an eye on the map
that you are currently playing in. They will also help you stay away
from computer enemies. If the other player is on a rooftop, this will
also decrease your chances of getting hit by a long range projectile
from him. You also have more battle options from the rooftop. For
example, if the other player is walking on the ground below you,
you could jump behind them and hit them from the behind. This will
vastly increase your chances of winning.</p>

<p>Thanks to BNii for this whole section that he let me use out of his
FAQ/Walkthrough on the game. You can check it out at GameFAQs.com
among other sites.</p>
<p>This section will give you both of the alternate endings for Rikimaru
and Ayame and it will explain the B-Side dialogue. The alternate
endings are obtained by doing one of the two options on the Cemetery
level for either character.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Both Rikimaru and Ayame have two possible endings, and a variation of
cut scenes involving the boss for their ninth mission (Onikage of
Rikimaru and Tatsumaru for Ayame). The branching point for the endings
occurs in Rikimaru’s sixth mission (Cemetery) and Ayame’s sixth mission
(Amagai Castle). These are spoilers so consider yourself warned.</p>

<h4>Rikimaru Ending 1 - Use the Shichishito sword to repair Izayoi.<a class="headerlink" href="#rikimaru-ending-1-use-the-shichishito-sword-to-repair-izayoi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Rikimaru asks Ressai to use the Shichishito sword to repair Izayoi.
Ressai asks if he’s certain, as although the steel in the Shichishito
sword is as strong as the steel in Izayoi, combining the two could
have unexpected results. Rikimaru asks him to do his best, then
retrieves the additional steel for Ressai to repair the Izayoi.</p>
<p>When Rikimaru confronts Onikage at Tenrai’s fortress, he is suddenly
struck by mysterious energy emanating from the sword. Onikage tells
him that he’s fallen for his trap. He intentionally plotted to let
Rikimaru retrieve the Shichishito sword and repair Izayoi with it.
Now that the Shichishito’s power is running through the sword,
nothing can stop Mei-Oh’s return. Despite the evil energy in Izayoi,
Rikimaru still manages to defeat Onikage.</p>
<p>Rikimaru confronts Tenrai and begins to do battle with him. Tenrai
calls forth the power of Mei-Oh and it seems that Rikimaru is powerless
against him. Tatsumaru’s voice calls to Rikimaru to use the power of
Doujutsu and focus on his right eye. With renewed strength Rikimaru fight
back. But the power of the Shichishito in Izayoi is overwhelming, sending
the sword flying through the air. Ayame tries to give the sword back to
Rikimaru, but the sword is too powerful for her to handle. Against all
odds Rikimaru grabs Izayoi and manages to defeat Tenrai.</p>
<p>Lord Godha and Sekiya arrive to see Tenrai standing. Sekiya panics but
Tenrai ends up falling over dead, with Rikimaru victorious behind him.
Gohda comments on how lucky they are to have the Azuma ninja on their
side.</p>

<h4>Rikimaru Ending 2 - Don’t use any new steel.<a class="headerlink" href="#rikimaru-ending-2-don-t-use-any-new-steel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Rikimaru tells Ressai to do his best to repair Izayoi with the steel he
has on hand. Later at Tenrai’s fortress Rikimaru fights Onikage in a
climactic battle. Rikimaru then confronts Tenrai and begins to do battle
with him. Tenrai calls forth the power of Mei-Oh and it seems that
Rikimaru is powerless against him. Tatsumaru’s voice calls to Rikimaru
to use the power of Doujutsu and focus on his right eye. With renewed
strength Rikimaru fights back. Tenrai is defeated, but in a last ditch
effort he leaps up to kill the exhausted Rikimaru. Rikimaru drives Izayoi
through himself, impaling both himself and Tenrai.</p>

<h4>Ayame Ending 1 - Let Rikimaru fight Onikage.<a class="headerlink" href="#ayame-ending-1-let-rikimaru-fight-onikage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Ayame lets Rikimaru fight Onikage while she hurries off to the Buddha
temple. At Tenrai’s fortress Ayame fights Tatsumaru in a decisive battle.
Ayame wins but spares his life, telling him that there’s much she has to
tell him. She runs off to confront Tenrai. Ayame fights Tenrai, who uses
the Jewels of Heaven and Earth to transform into a monstrous form. Ayame
seems powerless to resist, but the sister’s bells given to her by Princess
Kiku begin to resonate. The light from the bells cancels out Tenrai’s power,
and Ayame takes advantage of this and defeats Tenrai. Tenrai can’t believe
that he lost, and in a last ditch effort to destroy Ayame sacrifices himself
to free Mei-Oh from his prison. At this time Rikimaru and Tetsumaru show up.
Tetsumaru has a box filled with explosives (?) and tells the others to get
out of fortress while he destroys the portal for good. The two Azuma ninja
leave and Tatsumaru says that while he has strayed from his teachings, he’ll
make up for it by destroying Mei-Oh. He tells Kagami to wait for him (a
reference to Tenchu 2’s story line) as he blows himself and the portal up.</p>
<p>After the destruction of Tenrai’s fortress Ayame broods on the events that
have recently taken place back at the Azuma ninja village. As she looks at
the bells Kiku gave her, she hears Kiku calling her name. Kiku arrives
followed by a slightly winded Godha and Sekiya.</p>

<h4>Ayame Ending 2 - Fight Onikage yourself.<a class="headerlink" href="#ayame-ending-2-fight-onikage-yourself" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Ayame decides to fight Onikage herself while Rikimaru reports back to Godha.
She manages to defeat Onikage, but despite dealing a seemingly fatal blow
Onikage disappears yet once again. Later at Tenrai’s fortress Ayame meets
Tatsumaru again and defeats him in an epic battle. Out of nowhere Onikage
appears to attack Ayame, but before he can strike her Tatsumaru stabs and
grabs him. He then proceeds to step off the platform edge, taking both of
them to their doom.</p>
<p>Ayame fights Tenrai, who uses the Jewels of Heaven and Earth to transform
into a monstrous form. Ayame seems powerless to resist, but the sister’s
bells given to her by Princess Kiku begin to resonate. The light from the
bells cancels out Tenrai’s power, and Ayame takes advantage of this and
defeats Tenrai. Exiting the fortress, Onikage suddenly appears and attacks
Ayame, but is stabbed by Rikimaru. Onikage dissolves into nothingness while
a nonplussed Ayame ignores Rikimaru’s outstretched hand to help her up and
the two of them leave the fortess. Gohda comments on how lucky they are to
have the Azuma ninja on their side.</p>

<div class="section" id="b-side-story">
<h4>B-Side Story<a class="headerlink" href="#b-side-story" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The B-Side dialog track can be unlocked by earning a Grand Master ranking for
the first layouts of all of Rikimaru’s and Ayame’s missions. You do not have
to get a Master of Assassins ranking for all of Tesshu’s layouts. You can
select the dialog track in the sound option in the options menu. The B-Side
track is basically a humorous outtake on the normally serious dialog of
Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven. Note that the subtitles will not match the new
dialog so you will have to listen carefully. Onikage’s rant in the Limestone
Cavern is hilarious.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Just a little note, but if you want to see both endings for Rikimaru
or Ayame, just go replay the Cemetery level and pick the option
that you didn’t choose the first time. Then, beat the Cemetery level
and last level again.</p>

<h4>Frequently Asked Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#frequently-asked-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Q = Question</p>
<p>A = Answer</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Q: Is there a debug code in the game?</p>
<p>A: The debug code is supposed to be a series of codes this time around
instead of one long code. There are a few parts of it released already
and I will add the rest of them in this FAQ as they are released. Until
then, you could always check up on <a class="reference external" href="http://tenchu.de">http://tenchu.de</a> for the latest
Tenchu news and they will have the codes first.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Q: What is the score needed for the Grand Master rating?</p>
<p>A: You need at least 450 points.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Q: Can I still sheathe my sword and drag bodies?</p>
<p>A: No you cannot do either.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Q: Is there a level editor?</p>
<p>A: Nope.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Q: Can I play as Tatsamaru?</p>
<p>A: Not at the moment, but after the rest of the Debug codes get
released, there could be a chance at them letting you.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Q: On the Cemetery level with Rikimaru, I have a choice to do one of two
things to the sword. What happens if I pick the wrong one?</p>
<p>A: There is no right or wrong choice. The only thing that this affects
is two cut-scenes towards the end of the game.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Q: Should I get this game?</p>
<p>A: Yeah.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Q: For a ninja, why is Tesshu so big and slow?</p>
<p>A: Well, he isn’t a ninja. He is just an assassin for hire.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Q: How do I unlock the secret level, Through The Portal?</p>
<p>A: You must beat the game with Rikimaru, Ayame, and Tesshu.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Q: How do I unlock the B-Side dialogue and what does it do?</p>
<p>A: You have to Grand Master every level on the first layout for Ayame,
Rikimaru, and Tesshu. It is basically a different dialogue in the game
and a new plot. The new storyline is geared toward laughter and not
seriousness unlike the real story.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Q: Where is the Stone of Power for Rikimaru and Ayame?</p>
<p>A: It is in the Amagia Castle level for both of them. Towards the end of
the level where you have to go outside for a bit, there is a secret door
that you have to lean on to make it open right past the wooden bridge.
It is in that room.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Q: Where are Rikimaru and Ayame’s third weapons?</p>
<p>A: It is in the Buddha Temple level. Remember that pit towards the end
of it that was mostly gaps and you had to jump on the small planks of
wood? Well look in the pit until you find a platform. This platform is
like a little bridge. Jump down onto it and look for it down there.</p>
